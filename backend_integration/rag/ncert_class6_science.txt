Foreword
The National Education Policy 2020, envisages a system of 
education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its 
civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour 
and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to 
constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 
twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been 
well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School 
Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having 
nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five 
planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational 
and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression 
of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage 
acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, 
spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8.
This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students 
with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their 
lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and 
narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and 
opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering 
nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two 
languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, 
Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational 
Education promotes their holistic development.
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential 
conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in 
different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role 
in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike 
a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities 
for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom 
arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish 
conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on 
its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality 
textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been 
constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, 
pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made

all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook 
of Science for Grade 6, is one of these. It has been developed in 
consonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the 
NCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning 
by citing examples from the world of the learners. The content 
stimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical 
thinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from 
physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting 
themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive 
education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims 
to engage learners through an integrated approach by including 
multiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook 
offers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions. 
To encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard 
students as active participants in the learning process, rather than 
mere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can 
only be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to 
science teaching–learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The 
pedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important 
it is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. 
It also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from 
each other , making the learning experience more engaging for both 
teachers and students.
However , in addition to this textbook, students at this stage 
should also be encouraged to explore various other learning 
resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such 
resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will 
also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.
With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been 
involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it 
will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I 
also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further 
improvement in the coming years.

About the Book 
Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6 learners has been crafted 
in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education 
Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for 
School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The policy advocates a radical shift 
from a content-based education to a competency-based education, 
particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of 
curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning 
outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These 
curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including 
matter , the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the 
exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. 
Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, 
historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science 
and science communication. While these goals are explicitly 
articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute 
to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the 
chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, 
reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of 
the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and 
cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, 
Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education 
have been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to 
provide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and 
memorising the concepts.
In the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts 
an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops 
fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and 
earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners 
to appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense 
of their observations and experiences.
Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve 
chapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous 
opportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and 
its nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey 
that will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for 
further exploration. The hands-on activities embedded within each 
chapter engages the learners and provide them an opportunity to 
0 Prelims.indd   5 23/12/2024   16:06:55
Reprint 2025-26
vi
reflect on learning. These activities are inclusive in nature. Some 
activities require both the teacher and learners to prepare in 
advance.
Chapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a 
holistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle 
Stage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a 
way of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking 
questions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in 
the rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start 
their adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment 
exercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. 
Also, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that 
makes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with 
which the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively. 
The chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, 
these are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them 
with what is already known. The various activities given are based 
on scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on 
experiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help 
learners understand and assess how well they have grasped the 
information. Questions are significant in the learning process. They 
help learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will 
also find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage 
deep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions 
prompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts.
In order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the 
challenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange 
facts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on 
non-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More 
to know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific 
inquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the 
opportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters 
also include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the 
contributions of Indian scientists related to that concept. All these box 
items, including brief biographies of scientists, are non-evaluative. 
The important ideas and steps in understanding a given concept 
of science are included as ‘Keywords’ at the end of each chapter . 
These ‘Keywords’ will help learners to acknowledge various  
0 Prelims.indd   6 23/12/2024   16:06:56
Reprint 2025-26
vii
ideas and encourage them to think more deeply about the content. 
The keywords related to scientific processes depict the steps or 
procedure involved in the scientific activities. These words guide 
learners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and 
applied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, 
reinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content 
presented in the chapter . A non-evaluative interesting element that 
has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of 
certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in 
the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020.
The primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for 
becoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore 
efforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such 
as gender , region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity 
and energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to 
promote peer-learning and group activities.
The assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play 
a vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the 
understanding and identify areas for improvement, making them 
essential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment 
consists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating 
puzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging 
and interesting experience for the learners. These questions also 
facilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be 
developed through a particular chapter . Peer and group activities 
to explore answers to the questions are also encouraged.
A significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning 
further’. In this section, some projects and activities are designed to 
increase learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and 
the wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse 
information and draw their own conclusions. 
The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance 
their knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings. 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can also be a 
valuable tool for learners’ learning and development, when used 
appropriately. Learners can explore ICT with the help of Quick 
Response (QR) codes provided in the textbook. QR codes make the 
reading experiences more interactive and enjoyable. These QR 
0 Prelims.indd   7 23/12/2024   16:06:57
Reprint 2025-26
viii
codes that have additional resources can be accessed by the learners 
at their own convenience and pace. These additional resources 
include videos, puzzles, games, quizzes, audio, documentaries and 
additional content on some topics.
At the end of this book, learners will find a page titled ‘It is not the 
end, my friend!’. This includes words of encouragement, motivating 
learners to continue their educational journey and ignite their 
curiosity for further learning. It is meant to be non-evaluative.
May the journey of every learner be filled with joy and continue 
the curiosity in the higher grades as well! 
We express our gratitude to all the members of the textbook 
development committee for their contributions in shaping this 
textbook. We look forward to the feedback of the readers.

On a bright summer afternoon, Aavi and Thirav enjoy their 
shikanji (lemonade). After looking at the ice in the lemonade, 
Thirav wonders about the nature of ice and water.  
Aavi has a counterview to Thirav. What do you think? Why?  
Do you think Thirav is right? How can you find out?
If it does not rain well, even the mighty ocean 
will be drained.
(Thirukkural)
We can put 
water in the freezer 
of a refrigerator 
and check if it gets 
converted
 into ice.  
No, 
these are the 
same substances.
Ice feels hard to 
touch and we can 
hold it in our hands, 
whereas, water 
cannot be held in the 
same way. So, they 
must be different 
substances.
Yes, I know when 
water is left in 
the freezer, it gets 
converted into ice but 
probably something 
gets added to the ice in 
the freezer.

Activity 8.1: Let us observe
  Put an ice cube in a cup, leave it on the table and 
observe. 
Ice gets converted into water. 
What can you conclude from the observations? 
Does this mean that ice and water are the same substance? 
Yes, ice and water are the two forms of the same substance. 
These forms are also called states. These different states 
of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water 
flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does not.  
8.1 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act
It is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and 
Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the 
playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are 
surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles 
had disappeared. 
Have you ever noticed water 
in the puddles disappearing? 
Where does it go? Discuss with 
your friends. 
Where else have you seen 
water disappearing? Can you 
think of a possible reason why this 
  
          happens? 
You might have observed that after washing the 
utensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries 
up after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier 
to explain water disappearance apply in this case also? 
Aavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of 
the utensils.
Thirav thinks that water does not seep through the 
surface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate 
whose idea is correct. 
Activity 8.2: Let us investigate 
  Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in 
Fig. 8.1.
I think the water has 
been absorbed by the soil on 
the playground. What do you 
think about it?

Aavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of 
the utensils.
Thirav thinks that water does not seep through the 
surface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate 
whose idea is correct. 
Activity 8.2: Let us investigate 
  Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in 
Fig. 8.1.
  Observe whether water seeps through to 
the other side of the plate or not.
  Keep observing this at regular intervals 
until the water completely disappears.
What do you infer? Is this activity enough 
to come to the conclusion that water does 
not seep through a steel plate? 
If water does not seep through the steel 
plate. Then, where has the water gone? 
This water gets converted into gaseous 
state called water vapour. The water vapour is 
another state of water. Let us think of another 
observation where you notice the water 
disappearing.
While making dosa, we sprinkle some water 
on the hot pan and it disappears. Where does 
it go?  
Fig. 8.1: Steel plate with  
a tablespoon of water
The water which is sprinkled on the hot 
pan gets converted into steam. Steam is 
actually water vapour, some part of which 
converts into water droplets. 
The process of conversion of water into 
its vapour state is called evaporation. 
The process of evaporation takes place continuously, 
even at room temperature. Can you think of other examples 
of evaporation? 
Drying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our 
body are some examples of it.
Now what do you think is the reason for the disappearance 
of water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water 
into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of 
these?
Hand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. 
What happens to it? 
Water vapour is 
actually invisible 
but the 
presence of 
tiny droplets 
of water in the 
steam makes it 
visible.
Do you 
know?
Let us draw
Draw a detailed sketch (with labels and 
caption) about what happens to the water.

8.2 Another Mystery 
Next day, Aavi, Thirav and their friends decide to make 
lemonade. During the preparation, they take cold water in a 
glass tumbler and add ice cubes into it. After a few minutes, 
they notice something exciting about the outer surface of 
the glass tumbler.
Let us find out by conducting a similar activity ourselves. 
Activity 8.3: Let us experiment 
  Take cold water in a glass tumbler.
  Add a few ice cubes into it as shown in Fig. 8.2. 
   Leave it undisturbed for five 
minutes and observe it. 
   Record your observations and the 
questions that arise in your mind 
in Table
 8.1. You can also touch the 
outer surface of the glass tumbler to 
feel if there is any change.
Fig. 8.2: A glass tumbler containing 
cold water and ice cubes
One observation that arises in Aavi’s mind is, “There are 
some water droplets (tiny drops) appearing on the outer 
surface of the glass tumbler.” Initially, water droplets are 
deposited and these droplets combine together to form 
bigger drops. You can also try the above process with a 
metal container. You may be curious about where the water 
droplets come from. 
Suggest possible reasons explaining the appearance of 
water droplets on the outer surface of the glass tumbler.

You may have various possible reasons. Y
ou may agree 
or disagree with the reasons of others. Aavi and Thirav 
argued with a chain of reasons. What do you think about 
the possible reasons mentioned in Fig. 8.4?
Fig. 8.4: Chain of reasoning
We can take water at room 
temperature in another tumbler 
and find out whether any 
water seeps out.
No, it cannot seep 
out. The level of water in 
the glass tumbler has not 
decreased.
I think that some of 
the water may have 
seeped out of the glass 
tumbler.
It might have 
decreased, but may 
not be significant 
enough to be seen.

Continue the discussion on the given reasons or conduct 
activities to find evidence for the reasons given to help in 
this discussion. Where else have you seen water droplets 
like this?  
You might have seen dew drops on 
plants. Why do we see dew drops more 
in the morning? When we boil the 
water in a half-filled utensil and cover 
it with a steel plate, some water drops 
accumulate on the inner side of the steel 
plate. Where do these water drops come 
from? What do you think? 
When the water vapour present in the 
air comes in contact with a cold surface, 
it forms water droplets. The process of conversion of water 
vapour into its liquid state is called condensation. 
After understanding the concept of condensation of water, 
let us go back to Activity 8.3. Could the water appearing on 
the outer surface of the glass tumbler in Activity 8.3 also be 
due to condensation of water vapour present in the air? Let 
us investigate it.
Activity 8.4: Let us measure   
Aavi and Thirav conduct an activity to find evidence for 
their reasons. You can also conduct the activity by following 
the steps given below. Record your data in Table 8.2.
  Take a glass tumbler half-filled with water containing a 
few ice cubes. Cover it with a small steel plate. Weigh it 
on a digital weighing balance.
  Observe the reading on the balance and record the 
weight after every five minutes.
  Continue observing for 30 minutes. Record your

Activity 8.4: Let us measure   
Aavi and Thirav conduct an activity to find evidence for 
their reasons. You can also conduct the activity by following 
the steps given below. Record your data in Table 8.2.
  Take a glass tumbler half-filled with water containing a

Do your findings match with 
your predictions? Explain your 
observations.
You may observe some water 
droplets on the glass tumbler. 
Water vapour from the air 
comes in contact with the cold 
surface of the glass tumbler 
and gets converted into water 
droplets on the glass tumbler 
through condensation. There is an increase in the reading 
on the digital weighing balance. Can we conclude that water 
is not seeping through the wall of the tumbler? Can we also 
conclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only 
due to condensation? No, we cannot say that conclusively 
from Activity 8.4. What more can you do to show that water 
is not seeping from the glass tumbler? How would you 
modify Activity 8.4 to find the answer?
Repeat Activity 8.4 with the following modifications— 
  Mark the water level on the glass tumbler with a 
permanent marker or a visible tape. 
What do you observe? Water level in the glass tumbler 
does not go down but the extra water gets collected on the 
outer surface of the glass tumbler. What can you conclude

8.3 What are the Different States of Water?
Water is a substance that can be observed in three different 
states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On 
heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. 
On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous 
state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties 
of different states of water.
Activity 8.5: Let us identify 
  Put an ice cube in one container and transfer it to 
another container of different shape. What changes do 
you notice in the shape of the ice cube? Record your 
observations in Table 8.3. 
  Pour water from one container to another container of a 
different shape. Observe how water behaves compared 
to the ice cube and make a record. Did you notice how 
water flows from one container to the other? What 
happens to its shape? 
  Pour water on a clean surface and observe how it 
spreads. 
  When water gets converted into water vapour, how 
does this water vapour spread? Compare this with the 
spreading behaviour of water. 
What are the differences in the properties of water in 
solid, liquid and gaseous states?
Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the 
container in which it is placed while water takes the shape 
of the container. Ice does not flow or spread.  
Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water 
does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the 
container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains 
constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? 
Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the 
volume constant. 
Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of 
spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not 
possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room 
temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the 
air around us. The water that evaporates during processes 
like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the 
water vapour in the air around us. 
You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some 
other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, 
oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, 
liquids and gases.
Look around and find some examples of solid substances. 
Some examples could be stones, wood and glass.
What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? 
Here are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more 
examples.
Have you ever noticed that you can smell the food being 
cooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this 
smell reach us? 
It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking 
spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we 
are not in the kitchen.
What are the other examples of gases you can think of? 
What about oxygen and carbon dioxide?

and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water?

How can you quickly change ice 
to its liquid state, water? 
If we have to change ice  into 
water, and water into water 
vapour, we have to supply 
heat to it. If we want to change 
water into ice, what should be 
done?
It can be done by placing 
water in a cold environment, 
such as a freezer. Water freezes and is 
converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, 
it melts and is converted into water. 
Can you think of any other example, besides water, that 
can change from solid to liquid? 
A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. 
How can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can 
we change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should 
cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the 
other liquids you have seen which get converted into a 
solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into 
its solid state during the winter
 season? 
Hence, we can see that water and other substances change 
their states on heating or cooling. The process of conversion 
of a solid into liquid 
state is called melting. The process of 
conversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing.
Let us check the connection between different states of 
water through Activity 8.6.

What can you conclude from this investigation? 
If you spread out water on a plate, its area exposed to air 
is larger. Therefore, evaporation is faster. 
What would happen if milk is taken instead of water in 
the above activity? 
Other conditions which affect how fast water evaporates 
Design an activity similar to Activity 8.7 to find out what are 
the other conditions which can affect how fast water will 
evaporate. What would you change? What would you keep 
the same? Perform this activity, use Table 8.5 to record the

  Pour equal amount of water in each of the cap.
  Place one of the cap in sunlight and keep the other in 
shade as shown in Fig. 8.6. 
  Observe the two caps of bottles after every 15 minutes. 
  Record the time taken for the water to completely 
evaporate in each case.
  You can also repeat this activity on a windy or a rainy

Fig. 8.6: Evaporation of water in sunlight and in shade
What conclusions can you draw from Activity 8.8 and other 
similar experiences?
  Water evaporates faster from the cap kept in sunlight 
compared to the cap kept in shade. 
  It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on 
a hot sunny day. Do clothes dry faster or slower on a 
windy day? It is once again a common observation that 
clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in 
the movement of air, water evaporates faster.

8.6 cooling Effect 
Aavi’s mother purchased a new matka (earthen pot) to 
replace the stainless steel pot for storing drinking water. 
Upon returning from school, Aavi notices the earthen pot 
and drinks water from it. Aavi expresses surprise and 
asks, “Why is the water in the earthen pot so cold? I never 
observed water getting cold in a stainless steel pot.” What 
do you think is the reason?
 Water seeps through the surface of the 
earthen pot and 
evaporates, which imparts 
a cooling effect on the water. What are the 
other examples of cooling effect? Sprinkling 
water on the floor or the roof during summer 
to cool it, is another example.
How do you feel when you rub sanitiser on  
your hands?
Let us perform Activity 8.9 to observe the cooling effect 
by making a simple and electricity-free model of pot-in-pot 
cooler. 
Activity 8.9: Let us make a model  
  Take two earthen pots of different sizes. 
  Fill the bottom of the larger pot with a layer of sand.
  Place the smaller pot into the centre of the larger one 
as shown in Fig. 8.7.
  Fill the gap between the pots with more sand.
  Pour water in the sand area.
  Place a lid or wet jute 
sack to cover the top of 
the smaller pot.
  You can also make 
a drawing of the 
pot-in-pot cooler once it 
is ready.
Allow 4–5 hours for the mini pot-in-pot cooler to cool 
down. The time range can be influenced by many conditions. 
Observe and discuss how it creates a cooling effect 
inside the pots. Keep some vegetables and fruits in 
it and observe for a week on a daily basis to check 
for the freshness of the vegetables and fruits kept 
inside the cooler. You will have to add water regularly 
to keep the sand moist. For how many days can the 
vegetables and fruits be kept fresh in it? What are 
the conditions which can affect the number of these 
days? What else can be used in place of sand for 
better cooling? 
You all may be familiar with this unique clay pot 
which is called Surahi (Fig. 8.8). In summers, surahi is 
used to keep the water cold.
8.7 How Do clouds Give us Rain?  
Condensation plays a significant 
role in the process of bringing 
evaporated water back to the 
Earth’s surface. How does 
this happen? When air moves 
higher above the Earth’s 
surface, it becomes cooler and 
cooler. At certain heights, the 
air gets so cool that the water 
vapour in it turns into droplets 
which are generally formed 
around dust particles. These small droplets float in the 
air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form 
bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they 
start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. 
Now, 
I can understand 
why we feel cooler if we sit 
under a fan! The wind helps 
the sweat to evaporate 
and cools us.
The amount of water 
vapour in the air is 
more on rainy days 
and hence rainy days 
are more humid.
 Do you 
know?
  It is also a common observation 
that clothes dry slowly on a 
rainy day. On a rainy day, water 
evaporates slowly. If the amount 
of water in the air is already 
high (more humidity), water 
evaporates slowly.
If you want to dry your clothes on a 
rainy day, how can you make it faster?

Why does air containing 
water vapour go up in the

Fig. 8.9: Change of states and movement of water
The water from the ocean and the Earth’s 
surface evaporates into the atmosphere as 
vapour and returns as rain, hail or snow, 
ultimately flowing back to the oceans. 
This circulation of water is known as the  
water cycle. 
Only a small portion of water available on the Earth is 
fit for use by plants, animals and humans. Most of the water 
is in the oceans and it cannot be used directly. We use water 
for drinking and also for many other activities. The number 
of people using water is increasing with a rise in population. 
The increasing demand for water causes its shortage in 
many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important to use 
water wisely and avoid wasting it. Let us keep our water 
bodies free from pollution. You will learn more about water 
and its conservation in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’.

Malli and his sister Valli are excited for their summer 
vacations. Their parents have planned a trip to visit their 
relatives and friends living across India. They always stay 
in touch with their relatives and friends. Do you also keep 
in touch with your loved ones?
Their first halt is at their Nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) 
house in Haryana. It is surrounded by large fields. Malli 
and Valli are fascinated by the variety of grains piled up 
in the courtyard. Their Mami (maternal aunt) and Mama 
(maternal uncle), along with other community members, 
are busy separating small stones and husk from the grains 
with their hands.

They go around the house to see the fields and the 
cattle. To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of 
handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their 
eyes closed.
The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when 
two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and 
husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done 
on the basis of differences in size, colour and 
shape of the particles. If the particles to be 
removed are present in small quantities and 
can easily be picked by hand, handpicking 
proves to be a convenient method. 
  
At lunch, Malli and Valli are served 
steaming hot vegetable pulao. While 
eating the pulao, Nani observes that 
Malli is separating whole black peppers 
from the pulao and is placing them  
aside on his plate (Fig. 9.1). Valli playfully teases, 
“W
ow! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” 
Nani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and 
encourages Malli to eat it. 
Later in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields 
where they observe bundles of harvested 
wheat stalks lying in the fields. Some 
stalks are spread in the sun for drying. 
Both of them pick up a stalk each and 
notice numerous grains attached to it. A 
group of farmers are beating the stalks 
on a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli 
asks Mama, “Why are they doing this?” 
Mama explains, “They are beating 
the stalks to separate the grains” (Fig. 
9.2). This process of separating grains 
from the stalks is known as 
threshing. Farmers work hard, 
yet they enjoy their work. From time to time, 
they sing folk songs while working.

The separated grains get mixed with 
piles of husk.
Valli whispers to Malli, “Will the farmers 
handpick the grains to remove them from 
so much husk?” She wonders, “How much 
time will the farmers take to separate 
these?”
Let us perform an activity to find out 
the answer to the questions raised by Valli.
Activity 9.1: Let us explore 
  Take a handful of roasted peanuts and rub them 
between your palms. What happens? 
  Is it possible to separate the removed skin and the 
peanuts?
  Now, try blowing it. What do you observe?
Which of these components—removed peanut skins or 
peanuts are blown away?
You observe that blowing air separates the heavier and 
the lighter components.
How do you think farmers separate so many grains 
from
 husk? 
Traditionally, a 
soop (bamboo tray) is used for separating 
heavier and lighter components of a mixture (Fig. 9.3). 
Next day, their Nana takes 
them to the fields to show 
this process at work.
Malli and Valli observe a 
farmer standing on a raised 
platform. The farmer is 
moving the bamboo tray 
which contains threshed 
wheat grains in the direction 
of air or wind (Fig.

infer from Fig. 9.4? Do both the components, 
wheat grains and husk, 
fall at the same place? Which of the 
two components get blown away? Can the wind separate 
the two components?

Dada: But I can still get a few tea leaves in my mouth 
because decantation does not completely separate all the 
tea leaves from the tea.
Balan: Oh! It means it is not a proper method of separation.
Dada: Yes, you are right. The tea is ready now. 
Malli picks up the tea-strainer from the shelf and gives it 
to his Dada.
Dada: Let me pour the tea through this strainer. You can 
see all the tea leaves collected in the strainer. 
This process of separating tea leaves from tea is called 
filtration.
Balan asks Malli if he could use a tea strainer to filter 
muddy water. Let us try and find out.

of cloth and observe the difference.

washing and 
cleaning of rice 
and pulses.

Malli: Why should we use a piece of cloth?
Dada: In a piece of cloth, there are very small holes 
or pores  between the woven threads. These pores in the 
cloth can be used as a filter. People in ancient times also 
followed this practice.
But if the water is still muddy, impurities can be 
separated using a filter with even smaller holes or 
pores. A filter paper is one such filter that has very fine 
pores in it.

Malli and Valli go on a 
boat ride in a nearby river 
with their Dada and his 
friend, Otukkam. Otukkam 
is a fisherman. As they cast 
the fishing net, water drains 
out through the mesh. Valli 
recalls the filtration method 
she had learnt and realises 
that this method of catching 
the fish is somewhat similar. 
Malli is taken aback when he sees plastic bags, broken 
bottles, a large fish with a straw stuck in its mouth, and food 
wrappers along with the other fish trapped in the
 net.
Other than the filter paper, many materials such as 
cotton, charcoal, and sand can be used as filters. The 
choice of filter depends upon the size of the particles of 
the materials to be removed.
More to 
know!
Tea bags were initially made of soft cloth, like 
silk, because it could hold the tea leaves and let 
water pass through. Silk was strong and did not 
fall apart when it touched hot water. Later, people 
started using gauze or muslin. Eventually they began 
using filter paper, which is what most tea bags are made 
of today.

Summary
  Handpicking is used for separating solid materials on the 
basis of differences in size, colour and shape from a mixture.
  The process in which the stalks are beaten to separate grains 
from them is called threshing.
  The method of separating lighter husk from heavier grains 
by wind or blowing air is called winnowing.
  The process of separating solids from a mixture based on 
variations in particle size using a sieve is called sieving.
  Evaporation is the process in which a liquid gets converted 
into its vapour. It can be used to separate a solid dissolved 
in a liquid.
  The process of settling down of heavier insoluble component 
at the bottom of a liquid is called sedimentation. When the 
liquid is removed by tilting the vessel, the process is called 
decantation.
  Filtration can be used to separate insoluble solid components 
from a liquid.
  Churning is used to extract butter from curd.
  Separation of magnetic and non-magnetic substances by 
using a magnet is called magnetic separation.

water/grains. After obtaining some water in the container, she 
noticed that the water was muddy and fit/unfit for drinking. To 
purify the water, she kept it for some time and then she filtered/
churned the muddy water using a piece of paper/muslin cloth. 
Leela, then, cooled/boiled the water for about 10 minutes in 
a covered pan. After cooling/boiling, she filtered/churned it 
again and made it fit/unfit for drinking. She served this water to

tasks that you can do but a car cannot. You are a wonderful 
example of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group 
things around you as living or non-living, you can compare 
them with yourself. Which characteristics help you in 
differentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car 
does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which 
characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? 
Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the 
essential characteristics of living beings.
What are some common characteristics that make living 
beings very different from the non-living things? Let us 
learn about them.
Can we consider movement as one of the characteristics to 
differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five 
things around you that can move on their own. Do you think 
that all five things that you have listed can be considered as 
living just because they can move on their 
own? However, unlike animals, plants do 
not move from one place to another. Do 
you consider them as living? 
Even though plants do not move from 
one place to another, they do show certain 
types of movements. Opening of flowers is 
one of the examples of movement in plants. 
Another example of movement in plants is 
seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous 
plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera 
is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is 
featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like 
projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever 
an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and 
trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe 
the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous 
plants. Climbers also wind themselves around 
any object placed close to them. That means, 
even though plants do not move from 
one place to another, they do show 
some movements.
Compare yourself with the 
picture of your childhood. Can you

wear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, 
because you have become larger in size. This is due to growth 
in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can 
we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? 
Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth 
and development. List five living beings that require food  
to grow.
Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. 
Count the number of breaths you take per minute after 
a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. 
Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference 
in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice 
the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, 
cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen 
while they are taking rest. 
In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air 
moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe 
out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. 
Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do 
plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata 
on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking 
air in and out. Interact with senior class students in your 
school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using 
a microscope in your class. All living beings respire.
Have you noticed white patches forming on shirts around 
the armpits during summers? These 
patches are formed due to sweat. The 
sweat consists of water and salts removed 
by the body as waste products. Removal 
of waste products from the body is called 
excretion. Urine is also formed as a 
product of excretion in animals. Do you 
know that plants also excrete? You may 
notice plants excrete excess water and 
minerals in the form of small droplets on 
leaves. For example, grasses and roses.  All 
living beings excrete.
Let us look at another characteristic. 
What is your reaction if you unexpectedly 
step on a sharp object, such as a thorn,

while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot 
cup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are 
stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings 
to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural 
of stimulus) and your body’s 
instant response to them. 
Do plants also respond to 
stimuli? Yes, plants also respond 
to stimuli. For example, touch-
me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, 
lajjalu) plants fold their leaves 
when we touch them. Have you 
also observed that certain plants 
fold their leaves after sunset? 
Specifically, the leaves of certain 
plants facing each other tend 
to come together. This can be 
observed in the sleeping leaves 
of amla (Indian gooseberry) 
tree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more 
plants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after 
sunset. 
Why do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond 
in this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their 
behaviour?
Have you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? 
List young ones of five different animals. Have you seen 
young ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair 
or an electric bulb?
All living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the 
process of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is 
reproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity 
of life. 
When a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above 
mentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all 
resources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, 
it is said to be dead. 
From the above discussion, we can understand that 
all living beings share some common characteristics. For 
example, all living beings show movement, they need

Have you observed a seed germinating? You might have 
wondered what conditions are required for germination 
of a seed. What conditions do you think are required for 
seed germination? How will you investigate whether 
these 
conditions have an effect on the germination of a seed?
Let us find out by performing Activity 10.2.
Activity 10.2: Let us experiment
  Take four identical pots filled with garden soil. Sow 
four bean seeds in each pot. Now, keep these pots in the 
following conditions for 15 days. 
  Pot A: Do not water the soil. Place this pot in direct 
sunlight.
  Pot B: Add excess water to the soil such that water 
is always present above the soil. Keep adding water 
on a regular basis if water reduces. Place this pot in 
direct sunlight.
  Pot C: Keep the soil in this pot slightly moist by adding 
a moderate amount of water on a regular basis. Place 
this pot in a dark location.
  Pot D: Maintain the soil in this pot slightly moist by 
adding a moderate amount of water on a regular 
basis. Place this pot in direct sunlight.
  Indicate the availability of air, sunlight and water for 
the seeds in each of these cases in Table 10.2.
  When a seed turns into a sprout, it is said to have 
germinated. Predict whether the seeds in each pot will 
germinate. Record your predictions for each pot kept 
under different conditions in Table 10.2.

In the Chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, 
you have learnt that human beings need a balanced diet 
for good health and proper growth. Similarly, plants too 
need favourable conditions and nutrients 
for their proper growth and development. 
What other conditions do you think would 
affect seed germination?
In Activity 10.1, what are the 
characteristics of living beings which 
made you place plants in living beings? Do 
plants show growth in Activity 10.2? Are 
there any other characteristics of living 
beings that these plants show?
Let us study another characteristic that can be seen 
clearly in plants—growth and movement.
10.3 Growth and Movement in Plants 
How do plants respond to sunlight? Does sunlight affect the 
direction of growth of different parts of plants? In which 
direction would the root and shoot of a plant grow and 
move if the plant is placed inverted? How would you design 
an activity to find answers to these questions? 
Activity 10.3: Let us design
  Take some bean or gram seeds and allow them to 
germinate on a moist cloth or a moist tissue paper.
  Let them germinate until each of them develop into a 
seedling having a small root and a small shoot.
  Now, take three glass beakers or tumblers, and label 
them as A, B and C.
  Regularly observe the pots for 7–10 days to check 
the status of germination of the seeds. Record your 
observations in Table 10.2.
  Compare your predictions with your observations.
Do you think sunlight is necessary for germination of 
seeds? Do the seeds in all the pots receive air, water and 
sunlight? Is there any pot in which air is not available to the 
seeds? If so, why is it not available? What happens to the 
seeds in the pot where water is provided in excess? Which 
seeds receive both air and water? Identify the pots where 
you can notice the germination of seeds. 
Do your observations match with your predictions? 
Write possible reasons in favour of your observations in 
Table 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions 
which favour seed germination.
Which of the following are essential for seed germination–
air, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions 
in each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right 
amount of water and air. Why do seeds require these 
conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence 
of one or more of these conditions will affect 
seed germination?
Let us understand how these conditions help 
in seed germination. The effects of the following 
conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.
Water: Seeds require water for germination. 
Water enables the seeds to carry out the 
processes necessary for their growth. The outer 
covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water 
softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo 
inside it to develop into a plant.
Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the 
air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, 
spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.
Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for 
the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their 
germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for 
germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for 
further growth of the seedling.

10.3 Growth and Movement in Plants 
How do plants respond to sunlight? Does sunlight affect the 
direction of growth of different parts of plants? In which

move if the plant is placed inverted? How would you design

  Now, take three glass beakers or tumblers, and label 
them as A, B and C.
Do you 
know?
Some seeds of flowering plants, like Coleus and 
Petunia, require light to germinate. Covering 
these seeds with soil inhibits their sprouting. 
Seeds of flowering plants, like Calendula and 
Zinnia, need darkness to germinate. These seeds 
should be covered with sufficient soil.
How would you 
now categorise a 
seed, as living or 
non-living?

  Pour water into all the three beakers to ensure that the

From the results of this experiment (Table 10.3 and

1. When the plant is kept upright, the root grows downwards 
and the shoot grows upwards.

2. When the plant is kept inverted, the root bends and grows 
downwards. Also, the shoot bends and grows upwards.
3. When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction, 
the shoot grows in the direction of light 
while the root 
continues to grow downwards.
After conducting Activity 10.3, we can conclude that shoots 
of plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards 
sunlight but roots of plants grow downwards.
Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858–1937) was an Indian 
scientist who did some fascinating experiments 
with plants. He built a machine called a crescograph 
to record how plants respond to stimuli like light, 
heat, electricity and gravity. With this machine, he 
could measure how fast plants grow. He also showed 
that plants can sense and respond to stimuli.

10.4 Life Cycle of a Plant
We have learnt about conditions required for germination 
and how plants grow and exhibit movement. Let us now 
explore the changes a plant undergoes in its whole life.
Activity 10.4: Let us explore
  Plant a bean seed and provide suitable conditions for 
its growth. Observe regularly for three months.
  Record your observations in Table 10.4 as and when 
changes become visible. 
  Note the date when any change is observed. Record 
answers for the following questions—
  How long does it take for any change to occur? Make 
sketches of various changes that you observe in 
Table

  After how many days does the first flower appear?

  After some parts of the flower have dried, can you 
see any further growth?
  Which structure do the remaining parts of flower 
develop into?
  Can you notice a pod or a fruit with seeds develop 
from a flower? 
  What happens to the plant after the fruits containing 
seeds are formed?
Go through the observations you recorded regarding the 
growth of the bean plant in Table 10.4. What changes do you 
observe after the fruits are formed? Does the plant become 
yellow and dry even when you continue watering it? Sow 
the seeds obtained from your bean plant. Watch how the 
seeds give rise to a new generation of bean plants. Compare 
the sketches that you have drawn in Table 10.4 with Fig.
 10.4. 
A seed grows into a young plant and matures to produce 
flowers and fruit. The fruit, 
in this case a pod, contains 
seeds which give rise to a new generation of bean plants. 
The entire process from a seed to a plant, and then, to the 
next generation of seeds is called the life cycle of a plant 
(Fig. 10.4). When a plant stops growing and all activities of 
life gradually come to an end, even after the availability of 
all the necessary conditions, the plant is considered dead.

10.5 Life Cycle of Animals
We have learnt about the life cycle of a plant. We have seen 
that a plant goes through many changes in its life cycle. 
Have you ever observed how animals grow over time? Draw 
sketches of their young ones and name them. 
10.5.1 Life cycle of a mosquito
Mosquitoes buzzing around is a common experience for all of 
us. Female mosquitoes are bloodsucking insects that transmit 
several diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. You 
might have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards 
or awareness campaigns that mosquito
 breeding should be 
prevented. We are advised not to allow water to stagnate 
anywhere in 
our surroundings. Why is it so? Does stagnant 
water have any relation with mosquitoes laying eggs?

Conduct a safety audit in your school, or at your home 
and surroundings to check for stagnant water (if available, 
carry a hand  lens to observe any small creatures). Some 
common places where stagnant water is likely to gather 
are desert coolers, 
planted pots and any open container. 
You may find two different types of worm-like creatures 
(Fig. 10.5). They are larva and pupa, two distinct life stages 
during the development of mosquito. In case you observe 
larvae and pupae, report to your teacher. Discuss with the 
teacher and classmates about the necessary measures one can 
take to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. What differences do 
you observe in the shape of larvae and pupae? 
Fig. 10.5: Larvae and pupae of mosquitoes in a stagnant water body
Pupa
Larva
Mosquito larvae and pupae observed in water bodies 
repeatedly come to the water surface. What can be the reason 
for this? Mosquito larvae and pupae live in water and require 
air to respire. They move to the surface of the water for air.
How can the 
life cycle of a 
mosquito be 
disrupted?
I have seen my mother 
spraying kerosene oil 
on stagnant water. Why 
does she do so?
Kerosene oil forms a thin layer over 
the water surface. This layer separates 
water from air, and does not allow 
larvae and pupae to inhale air. As a 
result, they die.

Let us solve an interesting puzzle.
How will you decide which stage (larva or pupa) comes 
immediately after the egg stage? 
Suppose you are given a container with water from a 
puddle containing larvae and pupae. Design an activity to 
find out the correct sequence of these stages.
You can take help of the following activity designed by 
Avadhi to create your own activity— 
Step 1: I have a water container with mosquito larvae and 
pupae. 
Step 2: I will separate 4–5 
larvae and pupae into two 
separate containers with the same water. 
Step 3: I will observe them every day until 
I see them 
changing to the next stage. 
Step 4: If the larvae change into pupae, it 
would mean that 
the larval stage comes before the pupal stage or 
vice-versa.
Step 5:
 I will keep watching both the containers to see in 
which one a mosquito appears first. 
These observations will help us to learn the correct 
sequence of growth.
Now

from a puddle which contains larvae and pupae. Without 
separating them from the container, how would you design 
an activity to decide which stage, out of the two, gives way 
to the next?

Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a 
mosquito.
Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— 
egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). 
The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests 
briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult 
mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. 
We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg 
(stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva 
grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an 
adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays 
eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues.
Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape 
and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of 
a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the 
larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The 
pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it 
easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa?
The silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, 
pupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in 
size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they 
wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. 
These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. 
In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission 
(KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.

water body during the rainy season with a facilitator and 
explore it by taking due safety precautions. 
You may notice a white jelly-like substance on the surface 
of water towards the edge of the pond (Fig. 10.7). This may 
also be attached to plants growing in or around the water. 
This jelly-like substance is actually a cluster of eggs of a frog 
and is known as spawn.

Some of the stages have been clubbed together, for 
example, stages A and F in Fig. 10.7 have been kept under 
stage I. You will find four stages in the life cycle of a frog—  
the egg stage, which progresses to the embryo stage; the 
tadpole stage, consisting of an early stage with a tail and no 
legs, and a late stage with hind legs; the froglet stage, and 
the adult frog stage (Fig.

  How are these eggs of a frog different from the other 
eggs that you may have seen?
  Which stage has the shortest duration? 
  Is there a change in the habitat during the various 
stages in the life cycle of a frog?
  How do the special features support that stage?
Observe Fig. 10.8. You will see that tadpoles develop legs 
but still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles 
grow gradually and start looking like little frogs called 
froglets. They still live in water but begin to spend some 
time on land. They continue to grow and lose their tails 
completely. Their legs become strong to help them jump 
and land. They become fully developed adult frogs who live 
both in water and on land.

Plants and animals are a part of the living world. They 
go through various changes during the course of their lives. 
We have learnt that a tiny plant grows and develops into a 
big tree. We have also learnt how animals grow and change 
from young ones to adults. This journey varies for each 
animal, making it unique and special. We have seen pupae 
change into insects, and tadpoles change into frogs. Such 
changes are important for plants and animals to survive 
and to maintain continuity of their kind. We should also take 
care of them and their homes. By nurturing and preserving 
their homes, we contribute to this flourishing living world.

Summary
  The objects around us can be categorised into two types 
living and non-living. 
  The essential features of living beings are that they move, 
eat, grow, breathe, excrete, respond to stimuli, reproduce 
and die. Absence of any of these features indicates that they 
are not living beings.
  Each living being goes through several stages during its life. 
  Germination of seeds depends upon the availability of 
water, air and suitable light and/or dark conditions.
  During germination of seeds, roots generally grow 
downwards, while shoots grow upwards.
  A plant’s life cycle starts with seed germination, followed by 
several stages of its growth and development. These include 
flowering and seed production. Seeds produced during their 
life cycle would germinate into new plants and the cycle 
continues.
  The life cycle of an animal as a result of reproduction, begin 
with a newborn that undergoes various stages of growth and 
development followed by an adult stage and finally death. The 
process of reproduction maintains the continuity of its kind. 
  Mosquitoes pass through the stages of egg, larva, pupa 
and 
adult. The life stages of a frog include eggs, tadpoles, 
froglets and adults.
  In some living beings, such as mosquitoes and frogs, 
significant changes occur during the various stages of 
their life cycles. These changes can be seen in body shape, 
structure and sometimes even in the habitat.

Chapter
School vacations are always fun for Bhoomi and Surya. This 
vacation, they visit their Ajji (grandmother). Ajji lives in a 
village on the edge of a forest in the Western Ghats. The air 
in the village is fresh and cooler than in the city. They can 
see beautiful hills, streams, and many interesting plants, 
animals and birds around them. 
One afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya ask Ajji to tell them 
more about the place. Ajji says, “Children, do you know that 
this place has several treasures of nature that enrich our 
lives?  The pure air is refreshing and the soil is so fertile 
that it supports a variety of living beings. Moreover, this 
place gets plenty of sunlight which is useful in many ways. 
Different varieties of trees provide food and shelter to 
animals including various birds and insects. Can you think 
of more such treasures of nature?”

Bhoomi replies, “Ajji, we use water for drinking and 
growing vegetables.” Ajji says, “Yes. We need these treasures 
for our survival and for making our lives more comfortable. 
Without these treasures of nature, any form of life on Earth 
is not possible.” We all are a part of nature.
Ajji explains the importance of air around us and how it 
is essential for our survival. Let us find out more about air.
11.1 Air
One morning, Bhoomi and Surya see 
Ajji performing some breathing 
exercises. Ajji asks them to join her. 
She says, “I am taking deep breaths 
in, and letting them out. This helps 
in getting more fresh air in the 
lungs to stay healthy.” Bhoomi and 
Surya sit with Ajji and start taking 
deep breaths. 
Let us also perform a breathing 
exercise. 
Activity 11.1: Let us experience
  Take a deep breath in, and then breathe out slowly.
  Take a deeper breath in again.
  Hold your breath for as long as you can and then 
breathe out slowly.
  How long can you hold your breath?
  How do you feel when you hold your breath?
From this activity, we find that it is difficult to 
hold our breath for a long time. The air which 
we breathe in has oxygen. Our body needs 
oxygen to perform its functions. When we hold 
our breath for a long time, the body does not get 
enough oxygen to perform its functions. Thus, 
we need oxygen for our survival. Similarly, 
most of the living beings also need oxygen for  
their survival.  
Breathing exercise
Caution  
Do not hold your 
breath for so long 
that you start feeling 
uncomfortable.

Fig. 11.1: Composition of air
You notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree 
rustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages 
of an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on.
Moving air is called wind. Sometimes it blows fast, for 
example, during a storm, and sometimes it blows gently as a 
breeze. You must have played with a firki (paper pinwheel) 
many times. Let us make a firki by performing Activity 11.2.
The air which surrounds the Earth is a mixture of gases. 
Can you name some gases which are present in the air? Air 
contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and other 
gases in small quantities. Fig. 11.1 gives the composition of air 
in percentage. Notice that in Fig. 11.1 there are 100 squares. 
Out of 100 squares, 78 are occupied by nitrogen, 
21 are occupied by oxygen, and 1 by argon, carbon 
dioxide and other gases. 
Percentage is the number of parts in 100. It is 
denoted by the symbol ‘%’. More to

We have learnt that air is very important for us. Water too 
is essential and precious for us. How do you feel when you 
cannot get water to drink, especially when you are thirsty? 
Let us find out more about water.
11.2 Water 
Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in 
filling the troughs of water for 
the cows. They also help her in 
watering plants such as vegetables 
and medicinal herbs in the garden. 
Ajji teaches them how to water the 
plants so that every drop is used 
and none of it goes waste. 
Can you think of some more 
uses of water in your daily life? 
Write down your responses in the 
blank bubble. 
Activity 11.2: Let us make and decorate
  Take a square paper of size 15 cm x 15 cm, a pair of 
scissors, an all-pin and a soft stick.
  Follow the instructions shown in Fig. 11.2 to make a 
firki.
  
Now, you can hold the firki in your hand and run. 
You can also blow air on it. What do you observe? 
Does the firki rotate? When you move it a little back 
and forth, the firki rotates. What makes a firki 
rotate? It is the wind that makes a firki rotate. 
The working of a windmill is similar to that 
of a firki. Wind rotates the wings of a windmill. 
Windmills can be used to run flour mills, to pull 
up water from a well, or to generate electricity. 
In India, there are many windmill farms. 
A windmill farm is an area that has a large 
number of windmills which use the energy of 
the wind to generate electricity (Fig. 11.3).

cooking, bathing, washing and cleaning. It is also used for 
growing crops and for industrial purposes. Where do we get 
water from? Make a list of the different sources of water.
Water covers about two-thirds of the Earth’s surface. 
Most of the water is found in oceans and seas. However, 
this water is saline or salty. This saline water is not fit for 
domestic, agricultural and industrial use. For all these 
activities, we need freshwater, which is present in the form 
of ice sheets or snow, rivers or lakes on the surface of the 
Earth, and underground. Freshwater present in ice sheets

from homes and industries pollute our water sources when 
it is dumped into them. Identify other human activities that 
lead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class 
what you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is 
not fit for consumption by living beings.
As freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of 
water in many parts of India. At some places, people have to 
walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does 
not have the same kind of access to water. It is important 
for us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must 
also prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit 
for consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you 
conserve water? 
Water harvesting is one of the 
methods for conserving water. In many 
buildings, rainwater is collected 
and stored in large quantities for 
later use. This is called rainwater 
harvesting (Fig. 11.4a). 
Do you know 
that rainwater is also harvested in 
many homes, residential societies or 
schools? It is an age-old practice in 
India. 
For example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), 
commonly known as Bawadi in 
Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are 
built for water harvesting as a 
response to the scarcity of water in 
these regions. These stepwells have 
a unique system of water harvesting. 
They store not only rainwater but 
also water seeping from nearby 
lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of 
the trenches (long deep holes dug in 
the ground) are lined with blocks of 
stones that allow seepage of water. 
Find traditional water harvesting 
practices in your locality. Discuss 
with your teachers and parents to 
learn more about it.

In the chapter ‘A Journey through States of Water’, we 
have learnt about the water cycle, where the Sun plays an 
important role in the evaporation of water. Have you ever 
observed your mother or grandmother cut raw mangoes 
and expose them to the hot sun for several days to dry? Let 
us explore more about energy from the Sun.
11.3 Energy from the Sun
On a sunny day, Bhoomi and Surya are helping Ajji dry 
chillies in the Sun. Ajji says, “We use the heat from the Sun 
to dry it. We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not 
available. I will give you some to take home. Do you know 
that the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth? All plants 
and animals are dependent on it.”
We use heat and light from the Sun for various purposes. 
What are some of the activities for which we need heat and 
light? Bhoomi draws some pictures to show the uses of heat 
and light from the Sun. Help her by adding more examples. 
Draw the pictures and write their descriptions in the  
space provided.
Plants make food Drying of clothes 
One afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya pass by the field near 
Ajji’s house, where they see a cow grazing the grass. They 
talk about the Sun being the main source of energy. Read 
the conversation carefully and answer.
 
World Water Day is observed on 22nd March every year.

Sunlight helps plants prepare food. The Sun also provides 
all the living beings on Earth with heat and light. It is their 
main source of energy. 
Have you seen solar panels on 
rooftops, on top of street lights or 
on traffic signals? The solar panels 
capture the Sun’s energy and 
produce electricity. Energy from 
the Sun can also be directly used 
for cooking in a solar cooker or 
for heating water in a solar water 
heater.
The 
cow is standing 
in the Sun. But it 
does not mean that it 
is getting energy from 
the Sun.  
The 
cow is eating 
grass. Grass leaves 
need sunlight to grow. So, 
the main source of energy 
is the Sun.  This way the 
cow gets energy from 
the Sun.
In many households in India, water is offered to the Sun early 
in the morning as an expression of gratitude to the Sun.

One cannot imagine life on 
Earth without the Sun. The Sun is 
the main source of energy on the 
Earth. Plants get energy from the 
Sun and produce food. Animals eat 
plants and grow. We get food from 
both plants and animals. This cycle 
on Earth is possible due to the Sun. 
So, we all are dependent on the 
Sun as the main source of energy. 
Where do we find a large variety of  
plants or animals? Let us explore. 
11.4 Forests 
One morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in 
the forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in 
the forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense 
growth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect 
some nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) 
that have fallen on the ground. Ajji tells them, “We have a 
tradition in the village not to pluck fruits from the trees; 
they are left for animals and birds to eat.”
What will happen if the Sun 
is not visible for a few days?

Discuss with your friends and make a list of at least five 
products that we get from forests. 
Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, 
including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter 
to them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms 
for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every 
living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has 
been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large 
scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new 
forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve 
and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time  
to regenerate.
Van Mahotsav is a week-
long event celebrated across 
the country during the month 
of July. It is a forest festival 
during which new plants 
and trees are planted, and 
awareness about respecting 
forests is raised. The aim of the 
event is to increase the green 
cover. You too can plan a Van 
Mahotsav in your community.
From ancient times, India had a tradition 
of respecting, protecting and preserving 
forests. You have already learnt about 
sacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity 
in the Living World’. Many efforts 
have been made by common people 
to prevent the cutting of trees, and 
thus, saving forests. One such 
effort is the famous Chipko 
movement. It started in the 
early 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar 
Pradesh). Local women actively participated in this 
movement. They encircled and hugged the trees to 
protect them from being felled.

During their walk in the forests, Bhoomi and Surya notice 
that there are a lot of leaves on the ground and the soil feels 
damp. Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil 
and prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that 
fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. 
This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an 
example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in  
more detail.
11.5 Soil, Rocks and Minerals 
Bhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back 
home from the forest. Bhoomi 
and Surya help Ajji in preparing 
the soil in the garden for planting 
some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji 
asks them to dig the soil gently 
and loosen the lumps. You have 
already learnt in the chapter 
‘Living Creatures: Exploring their 
Characteristics’ that for plants 
to grow,  the space between the 
soil particles not only provides 
sufficient air but also space for the 
roots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small 
pebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the 
soil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that 
help in turning and loosening the soil?
While Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji, let us do our own 
experiment by performing Activity 11.4.

  Observe the soil samples with your naked eye. If you 
have a magnifying lens, look at the soil through it.
  Record your observations in Table 11.2.
  Is there any difference between your guess and what 
you can actually observe when you look closely?
  Do you see any differences in the soil samples taken 
from different places?
  Do you see differences in what you are able to observe 
with your naked eye and what you can observe with a 
magnifying lens?
There are many things in the soil, such as sand, insects 
and worms. There may be many small organisms that we 
cannot see with our naked eyes.  Plants and animals also 
become part of the soil as they decompose and decay. The 
soil samples collected from different 
places may be of different colours 
because they may contain different 
materials. 
Have you ever wondered how 
soil is formed? Soil is formed by the 
disintegration (breaking apart) of 
rocks by actions of the Sun, water 
and living organisms over a long 
time (thousands of years). There 
are different types of soils. Some

plants while some are good for making bricks for buildings. 
Forests have a variety of soils. Soil is a precious treasure 
that supports biodiversity. 
You may have seen rocks in your surroundings. Rocks 
are used in the construction of houses, buildings, temples, 
roads, dams and table tops. Some rocks, like slate, are used 
for roofing (Fig. 11.6) and laterite can be used as a building 
material, like bricks (Fig. 11.7). Some of the important rocks 
are granite, sandstone and marble. Human beings have been 
using rocks to make tools such as hand axes (Fig. 11.8a) and 
arrowheads (Fig. 11.8b) since thousands of years.

Rocks play a vital role in our lives. It takes thousands to 
millions of years to form rocks. Therefore, it is important to 
conserve and use them responsibly. Do you know how rocks 
and minerals are transported from one location to another? 
Most vehicles that we use for transportation use fossil fuels. 
Let us explore more about fossil fuels.
11.6 Fossil Fuels
What are rocks made up of? 
They are made up of minerals. 
Important metals, such as 
aluminium, gold, copper 
and iron are extracted from 
minerals. Minerals are used in 
the manufacturing of airplanes, 
cars, jewellery, cosmetics, and

  Record the information that you collect in Table 11.3.
11.7 Natural Resources: Renewable and  
Non-renewable 
Nature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential 
resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, 
we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and 
food from plants and animals. These resources which we 
get from nature are called natural resources. We also 
use natural resources to make many useful things for 
our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, 
solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. 
All such resources created by human beings are called  
human-made resources. 
You have learnt about various natural resources, such 
as air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, 
minerals and fossil fuels. Some of these natural resources 
Earlier, coal, wood and dung cakes were used 
as fuels for cooking. Nowadays, less polluting 
natural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) 
have gradually replaced these domestic fuels. 
Do you 
know?
Type of vehicle Type of fuel used
Table 11.3: Types of vehicles and fuels used
What are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol 
and diesel are the two most widely used fuels for vehicles. 
Petrol, diesel and kerosene are obtained from petroleum. 
Petroleum along with natural gas and coal are commonly 
called fossil fuels. They are formed essentially from the 
remains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep 
inside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural 
gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form.
Natural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. 
Nowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural 
Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than 
petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of 
electricity. It is found in several parts of India. Find out the 
major coal-producing states and mark them in a map of 
India.

Fossil fuels are found in limited quantities. Hence, we 
will soon run out of fossil fuels if we continue to use them in 
the manner that we currently do. To avoid such a situation, 
we need to explore alternate sources of energy. When fossil 
fuels are burnt, smoke and carbon dioxide gas are produced 
which pollutes the air. Over-dependence on fossil fuels for 
transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large 
scale air pollution.

get replenished through natural processes over a period 
of time. If you remember, Ajji told Bhoomi and Surya that 
they could collect only those nellikai that had fallen on the 
ground. This makes sure that there would be enough fruits 
for other animals and birds. The seeds from the droppings of 
animals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though 
it would take some years before we get fruits from these 
new trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished 
or restored within a reasonable period of time are called 
renewable resources. Air, water and forest are some of the 
examples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews 
them. We should use our natural resources judiciously. 
On the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to 
form. They are found in limited quantities and once used, 
they get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished 
within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called 
non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable 
natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum 
and natural gas.
11.8 Resources We use
It is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a 
wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) 
comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the 
vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and 
the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home.
They notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the 
smell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few 
trees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place. 
They can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. 
Amma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, 
smoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause 
less pollution. For example, there are electric vehicles that 
do not release any smoke. So, people are making an effort to 
create alternatives.” 
Can you list some alternatives for reducing air pollution?

You and your friends have listed many natural resources 
that we use everyday. These resources are air, water, soil, and 
food from plants and animals. We get these resources from 
nature and also make things using them for our consumption. 
Therefore, we must conserve our natural resources and use 
them responsibly without wasting them. This way, we can 
continue to fulfill our present needs while also saving for 
the future, without harming the environment.

Nubra is a beautiful region in Ladakh. An eleven-year old 
girl Yangdol and her twin brother Dorjay live in one of the 
villages of this region. 
They love their 
surroundings—the majestic 
mountain peaks, and 
the glaciers, but their 
favourite is the night sky 
when the entire sky is lit 
up with thousands of stars 
(Fig. 12.1). The weather in 
Nubra is almost cloudless. 
With almost no air or 
light pollution, the night 
sky is very clearly visible. 
Night after night, Yangdol 
and Dorjay observe the 
stars and experience an 
immense sense of awe.

the ancient days. They wonder how far away and how big 
the stars are. They also enjoy trying to find some patterns 
among the stars that remind them of familiar objects. Have

12.1 Stars and Constellations
At night, when we look up at the sky, we see 
many stars. Some stars are bright and others 
are dim. Stars shine with their own light. 
Some groups of stars appear to form 
patterns which are like shapes of familiar 
things. Long ago, when watching stars in 
the night sky was a favourite pastime of our 
ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, 
things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names 
for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary 
shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. 
Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill 
for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of 
modern technology or even before the invention of the 
magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors 
and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is 
still used in emergencies as a backup method.  
In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were 
called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which 
include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. 
However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are 
often the most prominent, the term constellation is still 
commonly used for these groups of stars.

their own stories about them. For example, the 
four stars in the Big Dipper that approximately 
form a rectangle, are viewed by tribes in Central 
India as the “grandmother’s cot” with 
the three thieves (other three stars)

stars as a boat, with the last three 
stars as the neck of the boat.

12.2 Night Sky Watching
If it is a clear cloudless night, a large number of stars may be 
visible in the sky. If you stay in a big city, you may find that 
the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the 
night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The 
presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred 
to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less 
light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, 
your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, 
which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed 
from open dark areas. 
Light pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our 
ability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some 
dark sky reserves and parks have been established 
around the world. Light pollution in the reserves is 
controlled to preserve dark skies for research. There 
are a few organisations which are working to educate 
people about reducing light pollution.
Do you 
know?
Not all stars and constellations are visible from 
all places on Earth and on all nights in a year. 
For example, the Pole Star is not visible from 
the southern hemisphere of Earth. To identify 
a star or a constellation, you need to know 
how a particular constellation looks like 
and where to look for it in the night sky. To 
get familiar with the pattern of a constellation 
you may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4. 
To find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or 
a constellation will be visible from your location, you may 
take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded 
on a mobile phone, or other online resources.
Sky Map is a very handy app for identification 
of stars, constellations and planets from mobile 
phones. Stellarium is another such app. The 
computer version of Stellarium is free for 
download and has many features.

Preparation for night sky watching
  Under the guidance of adults, identify a dark open area 
for night sky watching. This should be away from lights, 
tall buildings and trees. 
  Choose the date and time based upon what you plan to 
identify in the night sky. 
  Choose a moonless night with no clouds, particularly 
for the Pole Star which is not very bright.
  It may be useful to have access to a mobile app with a 
sky map, or print out images of the constellations you 
plan to view. You may also carry a magnetic compass 
to find directions and a notebook to note or draw your 
observations.
  On the particular day and time selected, go to the 
identified place with an adult, where the night sky 
watching is to be done.
  After reaching there, wait for about half an hour for 
your eyes to get adjusted to the darkness. This will 
help you to see the night sky better (Fig. 12.5).

Activity 12.2: Let us try to locate
  Look for the Big Dipper during summer time in the 
early part of the night, say, around 9 p.m. View the sky 
above the horizon towards the northern part of the sky 
and identify the Big Dipper. 
  Once you identify the Big Dipper, try to locate the Pole 
Star. Look at the two stars present at the end of the 
Big Dipper’s cup and imagine a straight line passing 
through these towards the north. At about five times 
the distance between these two stars, the imaginary 
line will lead to another star which is not very bright. 
This star is the Pole Star.

line passing through the three middle 
stars of Orion and look along this line 
towards the east. This will lead to Sirius.

The Sun
The Sun is a star. It is the star closest to us. It is an extremely 
hot spherical ball of gases. The Sun gives out a huge 
amount of energy, and that is why it glows so brightly.

Fig. 12.6: The rising Sun
The Sun, being the brightest 
object and the source of light 
and heat on Earth, was elevated in most 
ancient civilizations to the status of a deity. 
In India, the Sun is worshipped as 
Sūrya. The 
heat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth 
at a temperature that makes life possible. 
Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, 
which provide food and oxygen to animals, 
including humans. The Sun is responsible for 
climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, 
winds—all of which are important for 
sustaining life on the Earth. 
The distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. 
A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system 
is ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the 
distance between the Sun and the Earth.
The Sun produces heat and 
light, and is the main source 
of energy on the Earth 
(Fig.
 12.6).
How big is 
the Sun? It is 
about 100 times bigger than 
the Earth in diameter. And 
still, it looks so small because 
it is very far from the Earth.
However, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars 
hence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars 
(other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear 
like points, even though some of those stars are much bigger 
Our 
Sun is also a 
star. So how is it that 
the Sun appears big and 
lights up the sky while the 
other stars look like bright 
dots in the night sky and 
are not even visible 
during the day time?

than our Sun. During daytime, due to the extreme brightness 
of the Sun, it is not possible to view the other stars.
While revolving around the Sun, the Earth is also 
rotating about its axis. For one full rotation, the 
Earth takes about 24 hours which is called a day. 
Like the Earth, other planets also rotate about 
their axes while revolving around the Sun.  You 
will learn more about this in the next Grade.

Planets
A planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves 
around the Sun. Our Earth is a planet as it revolves around 
the Sun as shown in Fig. 12.7. The Earth takes nearly one 
year to complete one revolution. Like the Earth, there are 
other planets that revolve around the Sun.
The star nearest to us after the Sun is Proxima 
Centauri which lies at a distance of about 
269000 au. This means that its distance is about 
269000 times our distance to the Sun.

There are many more objects 
in the sky.  Our Earth, along 
with some of these objects, 
and the Sun together form 
our Solar System (Fig. 12.7). 
Most of these objects move 
around the Sun. The 
movement of an object around 
the Sun is called revolution.
Are stars the only 
objects in the sky? 
Or, are there more 
objects which 
we may not have

The eight planets, in order of their increasing distance 
from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Fig. 12.7). 
The inner four planets nearest to the Sun—Mercury, 
Venus, Earth and Mars—are smaller in size. They have solid 
surfaces with rocks on them.

Venus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk, 
and is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening 
Star, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet 
because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is 
reddish in colour.
A large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with 
water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, 
the Earth is also called the Blue Planet. 
The four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and 
Neptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are 
mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have 
large flat ring-like structures around them which are made 
of dust particles and rocky material. 
Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, 
the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The 
presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which 
can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is 
why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it 
is farther from the Sun. 
There is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, 
and revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s 
Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar 
System. But later, when similar more small objects 
were discovered, the International Astronomical 
Union (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of 
an object to be called a planet. As per this definition, 
these smaller objects, including Pluto, are now called 
dwarf planets.

So how can we distinguish between planets and the stars? 
Unlike planets, the stars appear to twinkle a lot. 
Activity 12.4: Let us try to identify 
  For most of the year, Venus can be 
located either at dawn or at dusk. 
  When you are viewing at dawn, 
look for it near the Eastern 
direction before sunrise. 
  When you are viewing at dusk, look 
for it near the Western direction after 
sunset.
While many of the objects in the sky can be seen 
with our naked eyes directly, we can see them brighter 
and larger using a pair of binoculars or an instrument 
called a telescope (Fig. 12.8). A telescope also helps us 
view many dim objects not visible by our naked eyes 
directly.
You may get an opportunity to view the sky through 
a telescope whenever a night sky watching event is 
organised in your region.
Many Higher Education 
Institutions conduct night 
sky watching activities for 
school students. There are 
many Amateur Astronomy 
Clubs all over the 
country which 
organise sky 
watching events 
periodically. Museums 
and Planetariums 
also organise similar 
events.

Natural Satellites
Objects that move around planets are commonly called 
satellites. They are smaller in size than planets. Moons are 
natural satellites of planets. The Earth has one Moon, while 
Mars has two moons. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune 
have a large number of moons.

The Moon
Earth’s natural satellite, the Moon, 
takes about 27 days to complete 
one revolution around the Earth. 
It is our nearest neighbour in the 
space. Unlike on the Earth, there 
is hardly any atmosphere on 
the Moon. How big is the Moon 
as compared to the Earth? The 
Moon is about a quarter the size 
of the Earth in diameter. The 
Moon’s surface shows circular 
bowl-like structures called craters  
(Fig. 12.9). Most of these craters 
have been formed due to the 
impact of asteroids or rocks 
from the space hitting the 
Moon’s surface. Since there is no 
In general, any object 
that moves around a 
much larger object can

For example, Earth can

the Sun.
The Moon 
is about 3,84,000 km 
away from the Earth.

To improve our understanding of the Moon, India’s ﬁ  rst mission to 
the Moon, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008 and the second 
mission, Chandrayaan-2, in 2019. The third mission, Chandrayaan-3, 
was launched in July 2023 and its Vikram lander carrying the Pragyan 
rover successfully soft-landed on the Moon on 23 August 2023. With 
this mission, India became the ﬁ  rst country in the world to 
achieve a landing near the little explored Moon’s south pole. 
To mark this success, the Government of India declared 
23 August to be celebrated as ‘National Space Day’ in India. 
A fourth mission, Chandrayaan-4, is being planned which 
aims to bring back soil and rock samples from the Moon.

Asteroids
The Sun and the planets are nearly spherical in shape. There 
are many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky 
and irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of 
these asteroids revolve around the Sun 
in paths that lie between those of Mars 
and Jupiter. This region is called the 
asteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally, 
asteroids pass very close to the Earth. 
Comets
Sometimes we have visitors from the 
outer regions of the Solar System! These objects with long 
tails are called comets (Fig. 12.10). They are made up of dust, 
gases, rocks and ice. As a comet approaches close to the Sun, 
the frozen material in it starts evaporating. This evaporating

Although the Moon is very far, humans have sent

Moon. India has also launched three Chandrayaan missions 
to study the Moon, and a further mission is being planned.

material forms the tail of the comet. Comets appear dim as 
they move away from the Sun and then, it is not possible to 
see them with the naked eye. 
Many comets have been 
found that revolve around 
the Sun. These comets 
approach close to the Sun 
periodically. However, there 
are a few comets that escape 
and move out of the Solar 
System. Few other comets 
get broken up, or fall into the 
Sun or other planets when 
they approach them.
12.4 The Milky Way Galaxy
In the moonless night sky, viewed from dark locations away 
from city lights, one can see an extended faint band of light 
from near north to south across the sky (Fig. 12.11). This 
is our home galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy or Ākāśha 
Gangā. A galaxy has millions to billions of stars. Our Solar 
System is part of the Milky Way Galaxy.

We have learnt about the 
objects which form the Solar 
System. Which are these objects? 
The Sun, eight planets, their 
moons, and many smaller 
objects including asteroids, 
and comets, together form the 
Solar System.
The Sun—our star—is the 
largest and the heaviest object 
in the Solar System. The Sun 
produces almost all the energy in 
the Solar System. All other objects 
in our Solar System shine due to 
the sunlight that they reflect from 
their surfaces. 
12.5 The Universe
There are many galaxies in the 
outer space beyond the Milky 
Way Galaxy. Scientists study 
them to understand the stars, 
galaxies and the universe.
In Sanskrit and a 
few other Indian 
languages, a comet 
is called Dhūmaketu. 
Various tribes in 
India also call it Pucchya-Taro 
(star with a tail) or Zendya-
Taro (star like a flag). 
In many cultures, comets have 
been feared and it was earlier 
believed that comets bring 
bad luck. However, thanks to 
scientists, we now know that 
these are just icy-rocky visitors 
making a trip close to the Sun!  
One famous comet is the 
Halley’s Comet which appears 
every 76 years. Its last 
appearance was in 1986.

As human beings, we have always been curious about our 
surroundings. We start exploring our surroundings and 
asking questions right from our childhood. Did you enjoy 
discovering and exploring the world around you in the 
Preparatory Stage of school? As you enter the Middle Stage, 
we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore 
and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for that, 
we have a new subject, Science. Welcome to the 
wonderful world of Science! 
Science is a way of thinking, observing and 
doing things to understand the world we live in 
and to uncover the secrets of the universe. Think 
of it as a big adventure—we ask questions, 
explore the world and try to understand how 
things work. For this, the most important thing is to have 
‘Curiosity’, which is where the title of this book comes 
from.
Whether it is studying tiny grains of sand or massive 
mountains, a leaf of grass or a vast forest, there is always 
something new and exciting to discover. Have you ever 
looked up at the night sky 
and wondered why the stars 
shine? Or watched a flower 
bloom and wondered how 
it knows when to open? 
These are just a few of

Science is like a giant and unending jigsaw puzzle. Every 
new discovery we make adds another piece to that puzzle. 
And you know the best thing about this puzzle? There is 
no limit to what we can discover, since every new piece 
of knowledge leads to more questions and more things to 
find out. Sometimes, we find that a piece of this puzzle has 
been put  in the wrong place and needs to be moved. New 
discoveries often change our understanding of the world. 
As you go through this book, you will encounter 
interesting ideas, do some thought-provoking experiments, 
and see how some of what we will find out is useful in our 
vastness of outer space, from what is cooking in the kitchen 
to what is happening on the playground, some of the 
most groundbreaking discoveries have often come from 
unexpected places.

different regions on this planet. You might have seen a seed 
grow into a plant, a caterpillar transform into a beautiful 
butterfly and many more such observations. How do these 
plants and animals grow?
What will we 
explore with 
the help of this 
book?
?
Of course, to grow, we need food to eat, and especially in 
a large and diverse country like India, food is so fascinating. 
Across the country, we have different cuisines with their many 
tasty dishes. What are they made of? How do we find out?

Then again, there are so many different things around 
us—the paper we write on, the metal key, the plastic ruler 
and the rubber eraser in our box, the magnet that keeps the 
box closed, the clothes we wear, the cup we drink milk in 
and so many other things. What are they made of? Are they 
made of different materials? How do we separate different 
materials from one another?
Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a 
delightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when 
it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains?
Have you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice 
when we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we 
heat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer 
or showering with warm water in the winter? How do we 
understand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own 
body when we have fever, finding out how hot something is 
can be important!

We will have an almost unending list of questions about 
everything on Earth as we further explore this book. But 
why limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask 
questions on things beyond—the Sun, the Moon, and the 
millions of stars that shine in the sky!
Whether you are learning about the 
structure of a leaf, discovering how things 
move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, 
we hope each chapter of this book will ignite 
your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will 
have lots of questions on your mind!
Even though you may have not realised, 
you have already been fi  nding answers to 
many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops 
writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the 
question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess 
that the ink fi  nished. 
You would then test this guess by opening the 
pen and checking the ink refi  ll. If it is empty, 
you would know that your guess was 
correct. But suppose you found that the 
ink was not fi  nished. Now what would 
you do? You would make another 
guess—perhaps the ink might have 
dried up. To test if this guess is correct 
or not, you will try something else. 
This is exactly how Science 
works! The way you tried to fi  nd 
out why your pen stopped writing 
is an example of the scientiﬁ  c 
method. 
Activity 1.1: Let us think and write
  Write about a similar problem that you tried to solve. 
  What steps did you take?
Science is not just about memorising facts and fi  gures or 
doing experiments. It is about following a step-by-step 
process that helps us fi  nd answers to our questions. So what 
are the steps that we can follow?
How can we try

on our own?

some extent, learning science will develop our capabilities 
for finding solutions to bigger problems and solving 
more mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn 
science well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious 
and observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are 
curious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? 
Just remember, the world is full of things we do not know, 
things that are waiting to be explored.
Activity 1.3: Let us think and write
  If you have to ask “Why?” about something, what would 
you ask about?
  Try to write down how you would attempt to find an

Science is rarely done alone. Scientists across the world 
work together, often in large teams. So, if you cannot find 
an answer yourself, ask your friends to help you out! It is 
always more fun to discover things together.
Of course, remember that you will not find answers to  
all your questions in Grade 6. Do not worry, you are

some birds and other animals, animals help in spreading 
seeds after eating fruits, and so on. Can you think of more 
such examples? This shows that plants and animals are 
dependent on each other.
2.2 How to Group Plants and Animals?
How would you arrange your books and notebooks in 
groups? Would arranging them in groups help you better 
organise your school bag? 
Now, let us look at the world around us. We are 
surrounded by a variety of plants and animals with different 
features about which you have learnt in section 2.1. We  
can group them based on similarities and differences  
among them. 
Activity 2.3: Let us group
  Collect pictures of various other plants and animals. Cut 
their pictures from old magazines, newspapers, charts 
and other sources. Paste each of these pictures on a 
different card. 
  Divide your class in groups of 5–6 students each. 
  Pool the cards prepared by the students in your group. 
  Observe various features of plants and animals shown 
on the cards. 
  Recall the features of plants and animals that you have 
listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.
  Group them on the basis of common features. 
  Share and discuss the basis of grouping you have made 
with other groups in your class. 
You will be surprised to see that the basis used by different 
groups may vary. What do you think are the reasons behind 
it? Different students might have chosen different common 
features for the grouping. For example, some students may 
have chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping 
while others might have chosen presence or absence of 
flowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). 
You may have grouped animals based on varied features, 
such as what they eat, where they live, what colour they are 
and how they move.
What is the importance of grouping? Grouping makes it 
easier to understand and study plants and animals on the 
basis of their similarities and differences. 
You will learn more about the importance of grouping in 
our daily lives in the chapter, ‘Materials Around Us’.
2.2.1 How to group plants? 
You must have noticed that plants show variation in the 
features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The 
stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and 
hardness, 
while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and 
arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in 
Activity 2.3 using one of these features.
You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants 
can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their 
height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants 
in more detail and group them on that basis.
Activity 2.4: Let us group
  Let us go on a nature walk again for some more 
interesting observations.
  Look closely at the height of different plants. Are  
these plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller 
than you? 
  Is the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems 
and try to bend them gently. Can you bend the stem 
easily, or is it stiff? Take care that the stems do not break. 
  Also, observe from where the branches of the plants 
arise—whether they arise close to the ground or higher 
up on the stem. Fill in your observations in Table 2.3. 
A few examples are already given.

What differences do you observe 
among herbs, shrubs, and trees? How 
can you group plants as herbs, shrubs, 
and trees based on the data entered in 
Table 2.3? 
Some plants grow really tall and have 
hard, thick, brown, and woody stems. 
Their branches typically start higher up 
on the stem and away from the ground. 
These plants are called trees. For 
example, a mango tree (Fig. 2.3a).

(c) Grass leaf with

Some plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often 
have many brown woody stems that start branching very 
close to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick 
as the stem of a tree. These plants are called shrubs. For 
example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig.
 2.3b).
Some plants are typically small with soft and green 
stems. 
These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a 
herb (Fig. 2.3c).
Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and 
grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the 
ground and are called creepers.
What can be other features on the basis of which you can 
group plants? Let us perform another activity.
Activity 2.5: Let us compare
  Look at the leaves of different plants collected by you, 
during the nature walk. 
  Do you notice any variation in the shape and structure 
of these leaves?
You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants  
(Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf 
is called venation. What differences do you see in the veins 
of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b?
In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of 
veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is 
called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus 
exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you 
may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called 
parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants 
and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c).

Do you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of 
venation present in their leaves?
Now, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants 
have roots? Are these roots similar? 
Activity 2.6: Let us find out
  Visit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are 
growing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. 
  Using a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different 
herbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may 
wet the soil and loosen it. 
  Wash the roots with water and observe them. 
  After you are done observing, make sure to replant the 
herbs so that they may continue to thrive and grow.
What are the similarities and differences in the roots of 
the plants collected by you? What differences do you see in 
the roots of plants shown in Fig. 2.5a and Fig. 2.5b?
Carefully observe the roots of a mustard plant in  
Fig. 2.5a. The roots of this plant consist of one main root 
and small side roots arising from it. The main root is called 
taproot. Another example of a plant having taproots is 
hibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in  
Fig. 2.5b is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant 
appear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from 
the base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots 
(Fig. 2.5b). Does your collection include any other grasses? 
What kind of roots do they have?

Do you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of 
venation present in their leaves?
Now, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants 
have roots? Are these roots similar? 
Activity 2.6: Let us find out
  Visit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are 
growing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. 
  Using a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different 
herbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may 
wet the soil and loosen it. 
  Wash the roots with water and observe them. 
  After you are done observing, make sure to replant the 
herbs so that they may continue to thrive and grow.
What are the similarities and differences in the roots of 
the plants collected by you? What differences do you see in 
the roots of plants shown in Fig. 2.5a and Fig. 2.5b?
Is there any relation between the type of leaf venation 
and the type of root of the same plant? How do we find 
this out?
Activity 2.7: Let us relate and analyse
  Collect saplings of five common plants from your school 
nursery or any other nurseries to plant in your school 
garden. Examples of such plants can include lemongrass, 
marigold, sadabahar (periwinkle), and others. 
  Before planting them, observe their roots and the 
venation in their leaves. 
  Record your observations in Table 2.4.

Do you observe any relation between the leaf venation 
and types of root in these plants? A sadabahar plant has 
a taproot and its leaves have reticulate venation. Do 
other plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? 
Lemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its 
leaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel 
venation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with 
reticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel 
venation have fibrous roots. 
Chickpea (chana) is another example of a plant with 
taproots and reticulate venation in leaves. Wheat is an 
example of a
 plant with fibrous 
roots and parallel venation 
in its leaves.

Is there any relation among the seed of a plant, types of 
root and leaf venation? Are all seeds similar?
Activity 2.8: Let us compare
  Soak some chickpea and maize seeds in water for two 
or three days. 
  Remove the seed coat of a chickpea. Now, observe the 
structure of the chickpea and maize seeds. Are they 
similar or different?
You would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two 
parts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that 
have seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons 
(dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants 
with such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots). 
What relation do you observe among leaf venation, root 
types and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant? 
Dicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system 
while monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous 
root system.
You have learnt about some features used for grouping 
plants. Now, let us explore the grouping of animals in more 
detail.
2.2.2 How to group animals?
Just like plants, animals too are significantly different from 
one another. How can we group such a wide variety of 
animals? What features can you think of to group them? In 
Activity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping 
animals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail.

You have recorded the movement of a few animals in 
Table 2.2. You may have also observed how other animals 
move from place to place. Let us now think about the types 
of movement in animals. A number of animals are shown 
in Fig. 2.7. You can add more animals that you may have 
observed and create a poster on the variety of animals. 
Which body parts are used by the animals in the poster you 
created and those in Fig. 2.7 for movement?
  List these animals in Table 2.5. 
  Note the ways in which these animals move and name 
the body parts used for movement. Some examples are 
given in Table 2.5.

What conclusions can you draw from the data given in 
Table 2.5? 
Different animals have different types of movement. 
Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. 
They use different body parts for moving from one place 
to another . They may use wings, legs, and other parts 
that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals 
based on the types of movement and the body parts used 
for movement. How can we group animals based on their 
movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each 
other in shape, size, structure, colour , and other features. 
Some of these features can also be used to group animals in 
various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important 
for understanding their diversity.
Janaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian 
botanist dedicated to environmental work and 
helped to document and preserve India’s rich  
plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the 
‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head 
of the Botanical Survey 
of India, she initiated 
programmes to document the plant diversity 
of India.

Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement
This is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of 
Kerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist 
evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous 
Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by 
common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of 
the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric 
dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At 
that time, people used all possible available means, such as 
widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles 
in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. 
The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley.
2.3	 Plants	and	Animals	in	Different	
Surroundings 
You might have observed during nature walks that 
different animals live in different surroundings.  
You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. 
Does the movement of 
these animals depend upon their 
surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. 
Fishes live in water . They have streamlined bodies and 
fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy 
areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes 
and shapes of animals also differ from one another .

During a discussion in the classroom, 
Alex recalls that he observed cactus 
plants with thick and fleshy stems in 
the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya 
shares that she saw deodar trees in 
the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh 
(Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in 
shape and have flexible and sloping 
branches. 
Notice that these two types of plants 
found in different regions are different

from each other . Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of 
a region vary from that of another? Let us find out.
There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot 
desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at 
night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these 
areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions 
during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems 
of plants found in the desert can store water and help them 
tolerate the hot conditions in these places. 
The mountains in extremely cold regions experience 
frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, 
some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off  
easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees 
enable them to do so easily.
You must have understood by now that the biodiversity 
varies from region to region because of diverse conditions.
Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of 
Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of 
Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe 
between them? What advantages do these differences 
provide to these camels?
The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. 
Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs 
and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy 
desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the 
height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively 
shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs 
allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food 
in their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one 
hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of 
food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. 
These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not 
much food available in the cold desert and they have to use 
food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they 
grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive 
the cold winters of Ladakh. 
What other features can help camels to survive in the 
desert?
Other students also start sharing their observations. 
Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small 
amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. 
As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they 
can survive for many days without drinking water. 
Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright 
flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. 
Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller 
leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain 
tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she 
has observed rhododendrons in the nearby 
mountains to 
be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons 
may exhibit different features in different regions to survive 
the conditions of those regions.
Sagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. 
He saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His 
father explained that the streamlined body of fish helps 
them to swim in water.

We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a 
particular region have special features that make them fit 
to survive there. The special features that enable plants 
and animals to survive in a particular region are called 
adaptations.
The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the 
rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive 
in the mountainous regions. 
The place where plants and animals live is called their 
habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea 
or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold 
desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. 
The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, 
water , air , shelter and other needs for their survival. Many 
types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. 
Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity 
of a region.
What are the different ways in which you can group 
plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to 
group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live 
in water’. 
The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in 
terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats 
are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.
Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India 
to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list 
of birds and documented their travel routes 
and habitats. He recorded the regions with 
high diversity of birds and took measures to 
conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park 
in Bharatpur , Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird 
Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of 
regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series 
of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. 
He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was 
awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976.

The plants and animals that live in water are said to live 
in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are 
ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.
Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as 
on land. These are called amphibians.
What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal 
is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass 
to eat? Can a fish survive without water? 
Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours 
to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal 
they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see 
as often now. These changes often happen when habitats 
are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals 
results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. 
This leads to the loss of biodiversity.
The population of the Bengal Tiger , Cheetah, and Great Indian 
Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats 
caused by human activities. The Government of India has 
initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project 
Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population 
of the Bengal Tiger . The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was 
initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah. 
Similarly, habitats of the Great Indian Bustards have been 
declared as Protected areas in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan 
and Maharashtra.

Traditionally Protected Forests: Sacred Groves
Sacred groves are undisturbed patches of forests. Their sizes 
may vary from quite small to very large. Sacred groves are 
found all over India. They are home to different kinds of 
plants and animals, including 
numerous medicinal plants. 
These are protected by the 
local community and no one is 
allowed to harm any animals 
and cut trees in these groves, 
or disturb the area. This 
way, sacred groves are 
a community protected 
treasure of biodiversity.

  We are surrounded by a large variety of plants and animals. 
Such variety of plants and animals is a part of biodiversity. 
  Plants and animals can be grouped on the basis of similarities 
and differences among them.
  Plants have similarities and differences based on features 
associated with roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and so on.
  The method of arranging things into groups based on their 
common features is called grouping.
  Plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on 
their heights, types of stem, and branching patterns.
  Plants can also be grouped as dicotyledons (dicots) and 
monocotyledons (monocots) based on the number of 
cotyledons in their seeds. 
  Monocots generally exhibit parallel venation in their leaves 
and possess fibrous roots while dicots typically exhibit 
reticulate venation in their leaves and possess taproots.
  Animals have different types of movement that can be a 
basis for their grouping.
  Biodiversity of different regions varies because of distinct 
environmental conditions.
  The special features that enable plants and animals to 
survive in a particular region are called adaptations.
  The place where plants and animals live is their habitat.
  Based on their habitats, animals and plants can be grouped 
as terrestrial and aquatic.
  Due to damage of their habitats, plants and animals lose 
their homes, food and other resources resulting in the loss 
of biodiversity. 
  We must protect biodiversity to ensure that our planet is full 
of life, helping plants and animals to survive and thrive.

Why do we see diversity in traditional food consumed in 
various states of our country? 
Analyse the data collected by you in Table 3.2. Are there 
food items that are common across states? Make a list of 
those food items. You may find that some food items are 
common in many states while some are eaten only in a 
particular state.
What relation do you find between the traditional food  
items and the locally grown crops? You must have observed 
that the traditional food of any state is usually based on the 
crops grown in that state. India is an agricultural country 
with diverse soil and climate types. Various crops are 
grown in its different regions depending on the soil 
types and 
climatic conditions. 
In various regions of India, the choice of food may vary 
according to the cultivation of food crops in that particular 
region, taste preferences, culture, and traditions.

3.1.2 How have cooking practices changed  
 over time?
You have learnt that food habits vary across states. Our food 
choices as well as practices of food preparation may differ 
from one another. Have our food habits and cooking practices 
changed over time? 
Activity 3.3: Let us interact and find out 
  Prepare a list of questions for gathering information 
from elderly people about their food habits and cooking 
practices. Following are some of the sample questions
 —
  What kind of food do you still eat and what is new?
  What are the changes in cooking practices over time? 
  What has caused these changes?
  Conduct interviews with some elderly people based on 
the questions prepared. 
What are your findings from the interviews you conducted? 
Cooking practices, also called culinary practices, have 
changed over time. There is a significant difference between 
traditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most 
cooking was done using a chulha (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most 
of us cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most 
grinding was done manually using a sil-batta (Fig. 3.1c). 
These days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding 
(Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking 
and grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed 
over time? These changes may be due to factors such as 
technological development, improved transportation and 
better communication.

Let us understand what Dr Poshita means by this 
statement. 
Have you ever missed a meal? How do you 
feel when you miss a meal?
We feel tired and less energetic when we do not 
eat for some time. Why do you think a marathon 
runner drinks glucose water during and after a race?
Glucose provides instant 
energy. Glucose is an example of 
a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates  
are one of the primary sources 
of energy in our diet. Cereals like 
wheat, rice, and maize, vegetables 
like potato and sweet potato, and 
fruits like banana, pineapple, 
and mango are some sources of 
carbohydrates (Fig. 3.2).
Do you know that common 
sugar is also a type of carbohydrate?
Why do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of 
our traditional diet in winters? 
Besan or wheat flour (aata) and ghee 
are among the main ingredients of 
laddoos along with goond (edible 
gum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and 
various kinds of oils are grouped 
under another kind of food 
component, which is called fat.
Yes, my grandma told 
me that laddoos rich in 
ghee and nuts provide 
energy to keep us warm. 
Sources of fats can be from 
plants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, 
such as groundnuts, walnuts, 
coconuts, and almonds, and 
seeds, such as pumpkin seeds 
and sunflower seeds, are some 
sources of fat. Fat is a source of 
stored
 energy.

Carbohydrates and fats provide us energy for performing

Polar bears accumulate a lot of fat under 
their skin. This fat serves as an energy 
source. It supports them during their months-
long winter sleep (hibernation), enabling them 
to survive without eating.

Proteins are also an important part of our food.  
Milk products and pulses are good sources of protein. 
Sportspersons need proteins in larger quantities to build their 
muscles. People get proteins from plants as well as animals. 
Some excellent plant 
sources of protein are pulses, beans, 
peas and nuts (Fig. 3.4a). Animal sources of protein are milk, 
paneer, egg, fish and meat (Fig. 3.4b). Protein-rich foods help 
in growth and repair of our body. These are, therefore, called 
body-building foods.

Case 1
In earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered 
from bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, 
Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who 
consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these 
symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a 
disease called scurvy.
Case 2
In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the 
human population in the Himalayan region and 
the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling 
at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per 
norms of the Government of India, an effort was 
made to supplement common salt with iodine for 
preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised 
salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were 
due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting 
in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling 
at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre.
The right amount of protein must be included in the diet of 
growing children for their proper growth and development. 
Which of these food components are part of your daily diet?
Have you ever seen mushrooms? They grow 
mostly in dark and moist places. Edible 
mushrooms are good sources of protein.

Why do you think we are advised to include servings of 
fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods in our daily 
diet? Let us understand the importance of some other food 
components by reading the following two cases—
What do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures 
scurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy 
is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present 
in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this 
disease.

How would you find out more about other food 
components that protect our body from various diseases?
Activity 3.4: Let us conduct a survey
  Study the chart given in Fig. 3.5 to explore the functions 
and sources of various food components. Find out more 
sources of vitamins and minerals. Also, understand the 
symptoms of the diseases caused by the lack of these 
food components.
  Visit your neighbourhood, interact with people and 
find out if any individual shows the symptoms listed on 
the
 chart (an investigatory project of this kind can be 
taken 
by the students under the guidance of a teacher).
  Correlate these symptoms with their diet and identify 
the deficiency disease(s) or disorder(s). 
  Suggest the possible cause(s) for the symptoms observed 
and changes required in the diet for improvement. 
  Suggest them to visit a doctor for further advice. 
What do you infer from Case 2? 
You may have learnt about iodised salt through 
newspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a  
salt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply  
common salt mixed with required quantities of salts 
of iodine.
Salt farming is a traditional practice of a tribal 
community named Agariyas. They practice salt 
farming in the Little Rann of Kutch and other 
parts of Gujarat. For eight months, they live in 
the extreme heat of the desert and work very 
hard to get salt from seawater.

Food components that provide energy, support growth, 
help repair and protect our body from diseases, and maintain 
various bodily functions are called nutrients. The major 
nutrients in our food include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, 
vitamins and minerals.
Vitamins and minerals are also called protective 
nutrients. These nutrients protect our body from diseases and  
keep us healthy . Your parents may have advised you to have

milk, green vegetables, fruits and wholegrains regularly. 
These food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig. 3.6) and 
mi
nerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in 
small amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. 
What differences do you observe in raw and cooked 
vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables 
sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and 
less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and 
others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it 
not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into 
our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may 
also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly 
recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly 
washed before consumption. 
Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see 
how dietary fibres are beneficial for us.
In
 addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary 
fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do 
not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an 
essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of 
undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage 
in ou
r food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. 
Do we obtain all 
nutrients from 
plants and animals? No, Medu. Nutrients like 
salt can be obtained from 
seawater or from rocks. 
Also, Vitamin D can be 
naturally produced by our 
body upon exposure to 
sunlight.

Green leafy vegetables, 
fresh fruits, wholegrains, 
pulses and nuts are good 
sources of roughage. 
Eating food that is 
locally grown and plant 
based, to the extent possible, is 
not only healthy for the body but is also good for 
our environment and our planet. 
Water is also an essential 
part of our diet. It helps the 
body absorb nutrients from 
food. It removes waste from 
the body through sweat 
and urine. We should drink 
sufficient water regularly to 
keep ourselves healthy.
My grandma has difficulty in 
passing stool. Now I understand 
why the doctor advised her to 
eat food that is high in fibre.
Coluthur Gopalan (1918–2019) initiated 
nutrition research in India. He analysed 
more than 500 Indian foods for their 
nutritional value and recommended an 
appropriate diet in the Indian context. 
He led surveys on the nutritional status 
of the Indian population, identifying 
widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food 
components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day 
Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, 
to provide balanced food in the government-run and 
government-aided schools of our country. This scheme 
has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of 
millions of children nationwide.

3.3  How to Test Different Components  
of Food? 
Let us find out which nutrients are present in various 
food items. 
Some nutrients 
like starch (a type of carbohydrate), fat 
and protein can be detected using fairly simple tests, while 
others can be detected only in a well-equipped laboratory. 
Let us explore how we can detect the presence of starch, 
fat and protein in some food items.
3.3.1 Test for starch
Activity 3.5: Let us investigate
  Take a small quantity of the food items such as a slice of 
potato, cucumber, bread, some boiled rice, boiled gram, 
crushed peanuts, oil, butter and crushed coconut. You 
can take other food items too for testing. 
3.3.2 Test for fats 
Activity 3.6: Let us investigate 
  Take a small part of the food items that you tested for 
the presence of starch in Activity 3.5. 
  Place each food item on a separate piece of paper. 
  Wrap the paper around the food and press it. Be careful 
not to tear the paper. 
  If a food item contains a little water, allow the paper  
to dry. 
Does the paper develop an oily patch? What do you think 
is the reason for this patch? If oil or butter is present in the 
food item, it leaves an oily patch on the paper. Now, hold 
the paper against light. Can you see the light faintly shining 
through this patch? An oily patch on the paper shows that 
the food item contains fat. Which of these items contain fats?
Record your observations in Table 3.3. 
3.3.3 Test for proteins
Activity 3.7: Let us investigate
This activity may be demonstrated by the teacher.
  Take the food items tested in previous activities. 
  Make a paste or powder of the food item using pestle 
and mortar (Fig. 3.8). 
  Put about half teaspoon of each food item in a separate 
clean test tube. 
Fig. 3.7: Testing for the presence of starch in various food items
  Place a small piece of each item on a separate dish.
  With the help of a dropper, put 2–3 drops of diluted 
iodine solution on each food item (Fig. 3.7). 
  Observe if there are any changes in the colour of the 
food items. Have they turned blue-black? Record your 
observations in Table 3.3.
A blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch.

  Now, take another dropper and add 10 drops of caustic 
soda solution to each tube (Fig. 3.8). 
  Shake well and leave the test tubes undisturbed for a 
few minutes. 3.4 Balanced Diet
Are nutritional requirements the same for everyone? Do 
you and your grandparents need the same type or the same

other food components need to be added. 
A diet that has all essential nutrients, roughage, and water 
in the right amount for proper growth and development of 
the body is known as a balanced diet. What changes would 
you make in your diet to make it a balanced diet?

What did you observe? Did the content of some test tubes 
turn violet? This violet colour indicates the presence  
of proteins in the food item. Write your observations in 
Table 3.3.
What conclusions can you draw from Table 3.3? Which 
food items show the presence of more than one nutrient? 
Which food items show the presence of both proteins and 
fats? Peanuts show the presence of both proteins and fats. 
This indicates that any food which we eat may contain 
multiple nutrients. Is there a food item that lacks any of 
these nutrients? Which of these foods do you consume 
daily? Try to find out other foods that are good sources of 
starch, fats, and proteins.

fat content. Moreover, they contain very low amounts of 
proteins, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres. These foods 
are called junk foods. These foods include potato wafers, 
candy bars and carbonated drinks. Consuming these foods 
frequently is not good as these are not healthy for our body. 
They make a person obese. Such a person may suffer from 
several health problems. You should always remember  
Dr Poshita’s statement that ʻHealth is the Ultimate Wealth.ʼ 
We should take care of our body to stay healthy. Eating a 
balanced diet and avoiding junk food contribute towards

climatic conditions. 
These highly nutritious 
grains are also called 
millets. Have you ever 
had food items made 
from these millets? 
Millets are small-sized grains and have been an integral 
part of the Indian diet for centuries. They have regained 
popularity due to their numerous health benefits. They are 
good sources of vitamins, minerals like iron and calcium, 
and dietary fibres as well. That is the reason they are 
also called nutri-cereals. They contribute significantly to 
a balanced diet required for the normal functioning of 
our body.

3.6 Food Miles: From Farm to Our Plate
How does food reach from a farm to our plate? What are the 
steps involved in this process? Who are the people involved 
in this process? Do you know how much time and effort is 
required to get the wheat flour once seed grains germinate 
in the farm? Let us look at Fig. 3.10 to understand the entire 
process of making the chapati that we eat. 
The entire distance travelled by a bag of wheat or any 
other food item, from the producer to the consumer, is 
known as its food miles. Reducing food miles is important 
because it helps to cut down the cost and pollution during 
its transport; it helps support local farmers; and it also 
keeps our food fresh and healthy.

  People across India eat diverse types of food, containing 
various food components. 
  Choice of food may vary according to the cultivation of food 
crops in a region, taste preferences, culture and traditions, 
and so on.
Summary
Many people waste food, leaving it 
unconsumed on their plates. One must 
remember the time and effort put by our 
farmers and other community members in 
getting the food from the farm to our plate. 
We must take only as much food as we can 
consume. It would reduce food wastage. Try 
to find the timeline for the various processes 
involved in getting the food from farm to plate (Fig.
 3.10).

Let us enhance our learning 
  Culinary practices have changed over time. There is a 
significant difference between traditional and modern 
methods of cooking food.
  Food provides us energy, support growth, repairs our bodies 
and protects us from diseases. 
  The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, food also 
contains dietary fibres and water.
  Carbohydrates and fats are primary energy sources, while 
proteins are body-building nutrients.
  Vitamins and minerals strengthen our body, protect us from 
infections, and keep us healthy.
  A balanced diet provides all the essential nutrients in the 
right quantities, along with adequate roughage and water.
  Deficiency of one or more nutrients in our diet for a long 
time can lead to deficiency diseases and disorders.
  Junk foods are unhealthy as they contain high levels of sugar 
and fats but little protein, minerals, vitamins, and dietary 
fibres.
  Millets are known as nutri-cereals as they provide most of 
the nutrients required for the normal functioning of our 
bodies. They can be easily cultivated in different climatic 
conditions.
  Eating food that is locally grown and plant-based, to the 
extent possible, is not only healthy for our bodies but is also 
good for our environment and our planet.
  The distance travelled by a food item, from the place of its 
production to the consumer, is called food miles. We must 
aim to minimise food miles.
  We should never waste food and only take as much as we 
can consume.

Reshma lives in a coastal town of 
Kerala and is very fond of writing 
short stories. Her grandmother 
loves listening to her stories, so 
Reshma was writing a new story 
to share with her grandmother 
on her 60th birthday. 
Exploring Magnets
The story was based on a ship 
carrying spices from Kerala for 
trade in the olden days. Reshma 
was aware that in those days, 
the sailors used stars to find 
directions at night. But in her 
story, a situation arose wherein 
the sailors got caught in a storm 
with an overcast sky and stars 
were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward 
as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions.  
She searched for information on the internet and her 
school library.
 She learnt that the tr
avellers used a device, 
known as a magnetic compass, for finding 
directions.  
Reshma had seen pencil boxes and 
purses which had magnets to keep them 
closed. A writing board in her school 
also had a duster with a magnet. But 
she had never looked at those carefully. 
She now became curious to learn more 
about magnets and magnetic compasses.

The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based 
on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which 
were discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found 
out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. 
Now
adays, we have magnets made of different materials. 
The magnets that you find in your school laboratory and 
those used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial 
magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, 
some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2.

Was your prediction correct for all objects? Which 
materials stuck to the magnet? What conclusion can you 
draw?
Through this activity, we found out that some of the 
objects were attracted to the magnet and stuck to it, while 
others were not. The materials which are attracted towards 
a magnet are called magnetic materials. 
The metal iron is a magnetic material. 
Nickel and cobalt are other metals that are 
also magnetic. Some of their combinations 
with other metals are also attracted 
towards magnets. The materials which are 
not attracted towards a magnet are called  
non-magnetic materials. 
Which materials listed in Table 4.1 were 
found to be non-magnetic? 
4.2 Poles of Magnet
Activity 4.2: Let us investigate
  Spread some iron filings (very small pieces of iron) on a 
sheet of paper. 
  Place a bar magnet over them. Tap the paper and 
observe carefully what happens to the iron filings. 
Do you observe anything special about the way they stick 
to the magnet? Do the iron filings stick all over the magnet 
uniformly? Or do the iron filings stick more at some places? 
We find that maximum iron filings stick near the ends of 
the bar magnet, as shown in Fig. 4.4, while a very few iron 
filings stick at the remaining part of the magnet.
These ends of the magnet are called the 
two poles of the magnet—the North pole and 
the South pole. Most of the iron filings stick 
to the poles of a magnet of any shape. 
It is not possible to obtain a magnet with 
a single pole. If a magnet is broken into 
smaller pieces, North and South poles always 
exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet. 
A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist.
4.3 Finding Directions
Activity 4.3: Let us experiment
  Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of 
the magnet as shown in Fig. 4.5. You may need to adjust 
the position of the string till the magnet is balanced 
horizontally.
  Now rotate the magnet gently in the 
horizontal direction and let it come to rest. 
  Mark the position corresponding to the 
ends of the magnet on the ground (or on 
a piece of paper stuck to the ground). Join 
these two points on the ground with a 
line. This line indicates the direction along 
which the magnet comes to rest. 
  Now again rotate the magnet by giving a 
gentle push at its one end and wait till it 
comes to rest. Does the magnet rest along 
the same line?

A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the 
north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points 
towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or 
the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points 
towards the South direction is called the South-seeking 
pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended 
magnet rests along the north-south direction because our 
Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet.
Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of 
the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest 
along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along 
any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along 
north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way 
to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. 
The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest 
along the north-south direction is used to find directions. 
Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was 
developed in olden days for finding directions. It 
has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can 
rotate freely (Fig.
 4.6). The needle of a magnetic 
compass indicates the north-south direction.
The compass is kept at the place where we 
wish 
to know the directions. After some time, the 
needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. 
The compass box is then gently rotated until the 
north and south marked on the dial are aligned 
with the needle. Now all directions at that place 
are as indicated on the dial.
A magnetic compass is usually a small circular box 
with a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. 
The magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted 
on a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This 
needle is balanced on the pin in such a 
manner that it can move around this point 
easily, that is, it can rotate freely. The end of 
the needle which rests in the North direction 
is usually painted red. Below the needle, 
there is a dial with directions marked on it. 
How can we 
make our 
own magnetic 
compass?

Activity 4.4: Let us construct
  Collect a few materials like a cork piece, iron sewing 
needle, a permanent bar magnet, a glass bowl, and water.
  Place the iron sewing needle on a wooden table. Then 
keep any one pole of the magnet at one end of 
the needle. Move the magnet over the needle 
along its length as shown in Fig.
 4.7a. When it 
reaches the other end of the needle, lift it up. 
  Bring the same pole of the magnet you started 
with to the same end of the sewing needle from 
which you began, and repeat the previous 
step. Repeat this process at least 30 to 40 times. 
  Bring some iron filings or steel pins near the needle.  
If the pins or iron filings get attracted to the needle, 
then that means that the needle has become  
a magnet.  
  Pass this needle through the cork horizontally. 
Float the cork in a glass bowl filled with water, 
such that the needle always remains above the 
level of water as shown in Fig. 4.7b. 
  When the needle comes to rest, your magnetic 
compass is ready for use. Note the direction in 
which either side of the needle points. 
  Rotate the cork gently and wait till it stops rotating. 
Repeat this a few more times. Do the ends of the needle 
always point in the same direction?

  Take a pair of bar magnets on which North and South 
poles have been marked. Mark the two bar magnets as 
A and B. 
  Place the longer side of magnet A over 5–6 round shaped 
pencils as shown in Fig. 4.8a. 
  Now bring one end of magnet B near the end of magnet 
A placed on the pencils. Make sure that the two magnets 
do not touch each other. Observe what happens.       
  Next, bring the other end of magnet B near the same end 
of magnet A (Fig. 4.8b). Does the magnet A on the pencils 
begin to move? Does it always move in the direction of 
the approaching magnet? What do these observations 
suggest?
You will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the 
North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another 
magnet, attract each other. The like poles, that is, either 
the North poles or the South poles of both magnets, repel 
each other.

Measurement of Length  
and Motion5
Chapter
Deepa, a curious eleven-year old girl, lives in a 
town in the state of Haryana. The new school 
year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform 
since she has grown taller. Her mother takes 
her to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre 
cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the 
cloth using a metal measuring rod.
Then, the tailor takes her measurements 
using a flexible measuring tape. Her mother 
instructs the tailor to increase the length of her 
uniform by char angula (four fingers width).
Are 
the tape and rod 
similar to the scale that the 
elder sister has in her geometry 
box? What did mother mean 
by char angula?
Deepa shares her experience with her school friends 
Anish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a 
discussion amongst them.

5.1 How do we Measure?
Hardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring 
cloth by the length of her arm.”
“Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to 
divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number 
of his strides,” says Padma.
“Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they 
also use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish.
Deepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts 
must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using 
a body part.” 
“What should we measure? Okay, let us 
measure the length of the table in our classroom,” 
says Tasneem.
Padma adds, “And which body part should 
we use to measure it?”
Deepa says, “Let us use our handspan. I will 
show you how to use it. I have seen my mother 
using it. She calls it balisht.”
Hardeep adds, “Okay. Let us also note down 
our measurements.”

Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for 
all of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table?”
“But why should the number be different?” Hardeep 
asked thoughtfully.
Tasneem says, “I can guess. Our handspans are of 
different sizes.”
Anish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”
So, all five of them put their handspans along each 
other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their 
handspans are different.
Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales 
and measuring tapes.”
Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table 
with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is 
expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan 
used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length 
is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, 
if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 
13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the 
measurement.
However, handspans and other similar units, such as 
length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to 
person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which 
measurements of the same length made by different people 
do not differ.

India has a rich history of measurement 
systems dating back to ancient times. Angula  
(finger width), multiples of angula, dhanusa, 
and yojana are some of the units mentioned 
in ancient Indian literature, and used in 
measuring artefacts, architecture, and 
town planning. The angula is still used by 
traditional craftspeople like carpenters 
and tailors. Several objects with ruled 
markings which could be scales have been 
excavated from sites of the Harappan 
Civilisation.

5.2 Standard Units
Several systems of units evolved with time in 
different parts of the world. However, when 
people started travelling from one place to 
another, it created a lot of confusion. This led 
to the different countries coming together 
and adopting a set of standard units of 
measurement. The system of units now used is 
known as the ‘International System of Units’ or 
SI units. 
The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol 
is
 m. A metre scale 
is shown in Fig. 5.2. One 
metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. 
Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You 
may be familiar with a smaller part of the 
metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in 
Fig. 5.3.
Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has 
markings (in
 cm) from 0 to 15. 
The length 
of any section between two consecutive big 
marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 
5 and 6, is 1
 cm. Observe that these sections

Fig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale
of 1  cm length are further divided 
into 10 equal parts. 
The length of 
one of these smaller parts is called 
a millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the 
smallest value of length that you 
can measure using this scale. 1
 mm 
is equal to one-tenth 
of a centimeter 
(1 mm = 0.1 cm).
For measuring larger lengths, we 
use a larger unit called a kilometre 
(km) which is equal to 1000 metres. 
And for measuring smaller lengths, 
we use units such as centimetre or 
millimetre. 
1 km = 1000 m 1 m = 100 cm 1 cm = 10 mm
Would it be convenient to use 
the unit metre to measure 
larger lengths, such as the 
length of a railway track 
between two cities, or to 
measure smaller lengths, 
such as the thickness of a 
page of a book?
?
In some scales, you might have noticed another scale 
marking. This scale marking is in inches, where  
1 inch = 2.54 cm. In earlier days, units, such as inch and foot, 
were used to measure length. These units are still used by 
some people.

5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length
For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. 
For example, if you want to measure the length of your 
pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of 
a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a 
measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a 
tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such 
measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s 
tape is more suitable. 
While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some 
points. 
What is the correct way to place the scale?
Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as 
shown in Fig. 5.4.
Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale
(b) Incorrect
(a) Correct
What is the correct position of the eye while reading 
the scale?
For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a 
pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye 
should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).
No, but we should 
first learn the correct 
way of using a scale 
to measure length.
Suppose we all measure 
the length of the table 
again, but this time using 
a metre scale. Will our 
results still be different?

How to measure the length if the ends of the scale 
are broken?
If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking 
is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With 
such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 
cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this 
mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in 
Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other 
end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is  
10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm.

How do visually challenged students measure lengths? 
They use scales with raised markings that can be felt by 
touching them.

5.4 Measuring the Length of a Curved Line
Anish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the 
arches of the verandah of their 
house, as shown in Fig. 5.7, for a 
celebration at home. How would 
they have measured the required 
length of string lights?
In the case of a curved line, 
measurements can be made with 
the help of a flexible measuring 
tape or by using a thread as 
shown in Fig. 5.8. 
Object Length of the object
While writing the length, do not forget 
to write the unit also. Thus, your result 
will consist of two parts—one part is a 
number and the other part is the unit of 
measurement.
Some of your friends in the class 
would have measured the length of the same 
objects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of 
your
 friends. Are the measured lengths the same 
or slightly 
different? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for 
the differences.
Why are some 
length measuring 
devices made 
up of flexible 
materials?
Units of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and 
millimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the 
beginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and 
mm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never 
followed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not 
written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. 
While writing the length, always leave a space between the 
number and the unit.

Who do you think is correct? All of them are correct

are locating the distances of the school and garden from their 
houses. If, instead, each of them had thought of distances

“Let us all go to the playground. The sports teacher wants

After a few days, Padma was travelling 
by bus to visit her grandparents in Delhi. 
She was eager to reach Delhi and was 
reading the kilometre stones on the side of 
the road. On one of the kilometre stones, it 
was written ‘Delhi 70 km’ (Fig. 5.12).
Further on, the next kilometre stone 
read ‘Delhi 60 km’. Each kilometre stone 
indicated that she was getting closer to her 
grandparents’ house.
These kilometre stones indicated 
her distance from Delhi. So, Delhi is 
the reference point in this situation.

Compare and analyse your justifications. How can one 
decide if an object is in motion or at rest?
An object is said to be in motion if its position changes 
with respect to the reference point with time. If an object is 
not changing its position with respect to the reference point 
with time, it is said to be at rest.

Deepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all 
the passengers were seated. She looked around again after 
a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She 
wondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position 
of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they 
were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she 
felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with 
respect to things outside.
The reference point is important in deciding whether an object 
is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or 
the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers 
were at rest. However, if she considered any object 
outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, 
then the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.

motion, it moves along the circular path again and again. 
An object in oscillatory motion also repeats its motion while 
moving to and fro. Both circular and oscillatory motion are 
periodic in nature.

wheel, every time it crosses it 
and produces a sound (Fig.
 5.23). 
 Now ride the bicycle slowly 
and count the number of times 
in which sound occurred. The number will give you the 
number of turns of your wheel made. Now measure the 
length of the outer boundary of 
the wheel using a string as done in 
Fig. 5.8. Multiply this length by the 
number of turns of the wheel. This 
is the distance you travelled.
  Such methods are actually used

a ‘Jones Counter’ which is attached 
to a bicycle wheel and is used for 
measuring distances.

  Group the objects shown in Fig. 6.1 based on any common

The earliest pottery found in the Indian subcontinent dates 
back to 7,000 to 8,000 years in the Ganga plains (Lahuradewa) 
and in Baluchistan (Mehrgarh). About 4000 BCE onwards, 
Sindhu-Sarasvatī developed techniques of wheel-
turned pottery production, pigmentation, application 
of protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of 
multiple colours, decorative painting, etc. These 
techniques became further sophisticated during the 
Sindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation 
(2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface 
painted with black-coloured designs displaying 
geometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial 
animals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, 
bowls and other items was carefully selected 
and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a 
wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay 
is called ‘terracotta’). Pots were used for various 
purposes, from cooking to storage of food grains, 
oil, ghee, and so on. Some very large storage 
jars and other pottery items are exhibited at the 
National Museum, New Delhi.

more than one object.
The method of arranging the objects into groups is called 
classification. Objects can be classified on the basis of a 
common property that they have. 
Similarly, we can classify materials based on certain 
properties.

We may use different materials for making different

different materials like plastic, metal and ink.

rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, 
and record your observations in the notebook. Group the 
collected pieces based on their appearance.
Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to 
have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are 
usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, 
aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their 
lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due 
to the effect of air and moisture on them. As 
a result, we often notice the lustre only on 
their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous  
materials are those that do not have a shiny 
surface. Some examples of non-lustrous 
materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.
“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old 
saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. 
Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by 
polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, 
wax or any other material which makes them look 
shiny. These materials may not be metals. 
6.3.2 Which materials are hard?
When you press different objects or materials with your 
hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, 
while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take 
a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of 
wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other 
material or object. Can some materials be scratched more 
easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or 
scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are 
difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these 
properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is 
harder than sponge but softer than iron.
Activity 6.5: Let us observe 
  Hold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands.
Feel whether the objects are hard or soft. Find out the 
materials they are made up of. Enter your observations  
in Table 6.3.
Fig. 6.4: Grouping of objects
Discuss in class other properties of sports balls, such as size, 
colour, texture and how high they bounce and understand 
why balls are made up of specific materials for specific
 sports.
Observe Fig. 6.4 and group the 
objects in as many different 
ways as possible.
You might have grouped 
these objects according to 
their shapes or by their 
colour or materials they are 
made up of.
We have learnt that 
materials may be classified on 
the basis of their properties. 
For example, in the 
kitchen, we usually store 
things in such a manner 
where similar utensils are 
placed together. Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types 
of spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner 
and so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire 
about how medicines are arranged.
6.3 What are the different Properties of  
Materials?
Let us learn some more properties of materials.
6.3.1  Observe and identify appearance of materials
Materials often look different from each other. Freshly cut 
wood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite 
different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different 
from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some 
similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make 
them different from wood.
Let us do a sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, 
cardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any 
article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the 
pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine 
when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether

You have learnt that materials can have different properties, 
like lustre, hardness, softness and colour. Can you think of 
any other properties that are shown by materials? Let us 
explore it further.
6.3.3 Explore materials through which one can  
see or cannot see
Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara are playing hide and seek with 
their friends. Ghulan hides behind a wall, Sheeta hides 
behind a big tree in the garden while Sara hides behind 
the frosted glass door (which has a hazy surface). Sheeta’s 
younger brother can see all of this happening through a 
glass window of his house. 
The materials, through which things can be seen clearly, 
are called transparent. Glass, water, air, cellophane paper, 
etc., are some examples of transparent materials.
Why did Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara choose these places to hide?
Do you think it would be possible for Sheeta’s brother to 
see her and her friends through a closed wooden window of 
the house?

There are many materials through which you are not 
able to see at all. These materials are called opaque. Wood, 
cardboard and metals are examples of opaque materials.
The materials through which objects can be seen, but not 
clearly, are known as translucent. Butter paper and frosted

6.3.4  What is soluble in water; what is not?
Ghulan was sweating when he came home after 
playing in the evening. He was feeling tired and 
thirsty. Ghulan’s mother mixed a spoonful of sugar, 
a pinch of salt and some lemon juice in a glass 
tumbler of water and offered him this shikanji 
(lemonade) to drink.
Ghulan noticed that while his mother was 
mixing sugar and salt in water, the salt and the 
sugar disappeared after a while.

We say that these materials dissolve in 
water or, in other words, they are soluble 
in water (Fig.

mix with water and do not disappear 
even 
after we stir them for a long time. These 
materials are insoluble in water (Fig. 6.6b). 
Water plays an important role in the functioning 
of our body because it can dissolve a large number of 
materials.

Make your own ORS!
ORS—Oral Rehydration Solution— is used to treat dehydration due 
to diarrhoea or other illnesses. These ready-made ORS packets are 
available in primary health centres and also in the market. Each packet 
is dissolved in a litre of water before use. If these are not available, 
ORS can be prepared at home by mixing six teaspoons of sugar and 
half a teaspoon of common salt in one litre of boiled and cooled water.
Some liquids get completely mixed with water. Some do 
not mix with water and form a separate layer when left 
undisturbed for some time. Similarly, some gases are soluble 
in water whereas others are not. For example, oxygen gas 
dissolves in water. It is very important for the survival of 
animals and plants that live in water.

Students are not able to sit because bags are kept on their

have occupied that space.
Continuing the conversation,

  Weigh each cup using a balance (Fig.  6.7) 
and record the readings in your notebook. 
  Compare the data and infer which is 
heavier or lighter.
From Activity 6.8, we can say that any object 
which is heavier or lighter can be measured in 
terms of a property called mass.
The one which is heavier has more mass 
and the one which is lighter has less mass.

Why is the level of water different in the two tumblers?
Madam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the 
same capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which 
indicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is 
different. 
The water in the first tumbler occupies less space, 
indicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less 
than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by 
water represents its volume.
You may have noticed drinking water bottles of different 
sizes being sold in the market. Have you noticed 1 L, 500 mL, 
200 mL, etc., written as net quantity on the bottles? These 
indicate the volume of water in the bottles.

Anything that occupies space and has 
mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter,

6.4 What is Matter?
Mass and volume are the two

general name to anything that 
possesses these two properties? 
Anything that occupies space and has 
mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, 
and the units to measure it are gram
 (g) and kilogram (kg). 
The 
space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to 
measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).
Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System 
of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. 
There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full 
stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. 
While writing the mass, always leave a space between 
the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, 
if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 
7 kg and not as 7 kgs.
Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and 
millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ 
in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, 
it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower 
case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for 
volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m
3. The 
abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to 
denote cubic metre. For example, if you have 
volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written 
as 2 m
3. Always leave a space between number 
(numerical value) and the unit. 1 m3 =1000 L.

Can all the materials around us be 
considered as different examples of 
matter? Discuss with your friends.
For example, water is matter, sand and 
pebbles are matter and so is the cup.
Materials are types of matter used in the 
creation or making of objects.
We learnt that materials look different 
and behave differently. We grouped materials 
on the basis of  similarities or differences in 
their properties. 
We find grouping useful as it helps us study and 
observe patterns in the properties of things. Humans have 
been classifying not only things, but also rocks, plants and 
animals. W
e have learnt about the classification of the living 
world in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Just like 
in 
the living world, classification of the non-living world is 
also done on the basis of their properties.
Is air 
matter?
Yes! But most of the materials 
that we see today would have 
also existed earlier. I am 
curious to know how people 
classified them then.
We have explored 
and understood the 
various properties of 
materials.

Is it a boon or a bane?

Lambok and his elder sister 
Phiban live in Shillong. One day 
they came home from school. 
Their parents were away at 
work and Lambok complained 
that he was feeling feverish. 
Phiban touched his forehead 
and felt that he might be having 
a fever. To confirm this, she 
took out the thermometer kept 
in the almirah. She washed 
its tip with soap and water, 
and measured Lambok’s 
temperature. To her relief, she 
found that his temperature 
was normal. She washed the 
thermometer tip again, dried 
Wrong measurements are worse than 
no measurements at all.

refrigerator. We can realise this by merely touching the two 
samples of water. But can we always rely upon our sense of 
touch? Let us find out.
Activity 7.1: Let us investigate
  Take three large containers and label them A, B and C, 
as shown in Fig. 7.1.
  Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and ice-
cold water in C. 
  We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction 
and observation.
  Firstly, predict what will you feel if you 
 — dip your right hand in A and left hand in C and 
keep them there for 1–2 minutes.
 — take out your hands from containers A and C, and 
place both hands simultaneously in B.
Compare whether your observations match with your 
predictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in 
container B is cool, while your left hand felt that 
the same water is warm? What do you infer 
from these observations?
We cannot always rely upon our sense of 
touch to decide correctly whether a body is 
hot or cold. 
7.2 Temperature
A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is 
its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature 
than a colder body.  The difference in temperature between 
the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to 
another body.  A device that measures temperature is called 
a thermometer.
There are two kinds of thermometers that you are  
likely to come across—clinical thermometers and 
laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used 
to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory 
thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us 
now learn more about thermometers and how to use them 
to measure temperature. 
7.3  Measuring Temperature
7.3.1 Clinical thermometer
You might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in 
Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. 
It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show 
temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital 
clinical thermometers and run on batteries. These measure

refrigerator. We can realise this by merely touching the two 
samples of water. But can we always rely upon our sense of 
touch? Let us find out.
Activity 7.1: Let us investigate
  Take three large containers and label them A, B and C, 
as shown in Fig. 7.1.
  Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and ice-
cold water in C. 
  We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction 
and observation.
  Firstly, predict what will you feel if you 
 — dip your right hand in A and left hand in C and 
keep them there for 1–2 minutes.
 — take out your hands from containers A and C, and 
place both hands simultaneously in B.
Compare whether your observations match with your 
predictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in 
container B is cool, while your left hand felt that 
the same water is warm? What do you infer 
from these observations?
We cannot always rely upon our sense of 
touch to decide correctly whether a body is 
hot or cold. 
7.2 Temperature
A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is 
its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature 
than a colder body.  The difference in temperature between 
the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to 
another body.  A device that measures temperature is called 
a thermometer.
There are two kinds of thermometers that you are  
likely to come across—clinical thermometers and 
laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used 
to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory 
thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us 
now learn more about thermometers and how to use them 
to measure temperature. 
7.3  Measuring Temperature
7.3.1 Clinical thermometer
You might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in 
Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. 
It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show 
temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital 
clinical thermometers and run on batteries. These measure 
Then how do we 
find out how hot 
or cold a body 
is?

Do you 
know?
Earlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring 
the body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic 
substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer 
breaks accidently. 
Digital thermometers pose no such risk and also the 
numbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore, 
mercury thermometers are being replaced by digital 
thermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer 
is determined with the help of heat sensors. 
temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact 
with a person’s body.
For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers 
generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this 
scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is 
denoted by °C.  
They are non-contact thermometers, 
also called infrared 
thermometers. Such 
thermometers can 
measure temperature 
without touching a 
person’s body and 
thus reduce the risk of 
spreading disease.
During the COVID-19 
pandemic, some special 
thermometers were used, 
which could measure the 
temperature of a person 
from a distance. What were 
those?

Activity 7.2: Let us measure
Let us now use a digital clinical thermometer 
to measure body temperature. You may 
measure your own temperature as well as 
the temperature of some of your friends. 
Talk to your friends to find out who would 
be willing to get their body temperatures 
measured by you.
  Wash your hands and the tip of the 
digital thermometer with soap and 
water.
  Reset the thermometer by pressing the 
reset button. 
  Place the thermometer under the 
tongue and close your mouth. 
  Wait till the thermometer makes a 
beeping sound or flashes a light.
  Take it out from the mouth and read 
the temperature on the digital display. 
  Record the temperature in Table 7.1.
  Clean the tip of the thermometer with soap and water, 
and dry it.
  Repeat the above steps for measuring the temperatures 
of your friends.

The normal temperature of a healthy human body is taken 
to be 37.0 °C. But in this activity, did you find that the normal 
temperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the 
temperature slightly higher or lower for some people?  
The temperature of every person may not 
be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature 
is the average body temperature of a large 
number of healthy people. A perfectly 
healthy person may, therefore, have a 
normal temperature slightly different from 
37.0
 °C. The body temperature is influenced 
by several factors, such as age, time of the 
day and activity level.
You may try measuring your own 
temperature at different times of the day and 
on different days. Record the thermometer 
readings in your notebook. After a month, 
analyse your temperature record and see if 
there are any variations. If yes, try to think 
what might be the reasons for that. 
The temperature of human beings does 
not normally go below 35 
°C or above 42 °C. 
For measuring the body temperature 
of small children or old people, the digital 
thermometer can also be placed in the 
armpit. The temperature measured this way 
is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual 
body temperature.
There is another scale of temperature 
known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the 
unit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and 
is denoted by °F.  A temperature measured as 
37.0
 °C on Celsius scale is 
equivalent to 98.6 °F 
on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is 
not used in most scientific studies anymore. 
In scientific work, there is another scale of 
temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this 
scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and 
is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature 
is kelvin.
Do small children 
generally have 
slightly higher body 
temperatures as 
compared to adults?
?
Do old people, even 
when healthy, generally 
have lower body 
temperatures than 
young adults?
?
I have seen a friend of mine 
using a digital thermometer 
that reads temperature on 
a different scale. It shows 
the normal temperature of 
a healthy human body as 
98.6 °F.  What is the reason 
for this difference?

The names of temperature scales—Celsius scale, 
Fahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale—start with a capital 
letter. For the units for temperature, degree Celsius and degree 
Fahrenheit, the word degree starts with a lower-case letter while 
Celsius and Fahrenheit start with a capital letter. The unit kelvin 
starts with a lower-case letter. The symbols of all units (°C, °F, K) are 
capital letters. Note that degree sign (°) is not written with K. A full 
stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. 
While writing the temperature, a space is left between the number 
and the unit. For temperatures more than one degree, use the plural 
of ‘degree’, that is, ‘degrees’, while writing the full form of the unit.
We can easily convert the 
temperature from Celsius scale to 
Kelvin scale by using:
Temperature in Kelvin  
scale = Temperature in  
Celsius scale + 273.15
More to 
know!
All three temperature 
scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit 
and Kelvin are named in 
honour of the scientists who 
developed these scales.
How was fever detected before 
thermometers were developed? Fever 
affects the pulse rate of a person. This 
was known even in olden days 
in India. However, apart from 
fever, some other situations 
also affect the pulse rate. 
Hence, pulse rate alone is not 
a reliable indicator of fever.

7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer
There are many types of laboratory thermometers but the 
one that might be available in your school laboratory may 
look like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long, 
narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of 
the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb, 
in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There 
is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column 
rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the 
Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column 
coincides is the temperature reading.
The liquid used in the laboratory 
thermometer is generally alcohol (coloured 
red to make it easily seen) or mercury.

Let us now try to find the smallest value that a given 
laboratory thermometer can read.
  Again, take the same laboratory thermometer which 
you used in Activity 7.3 and observe it carefully. 
  Note down the following:
 — How much is the temperature difference indicated 
between the two bigger marks? 
 — How many divisions (shown by smaller  marks) 
are there between these two 
bigger marks? 
 — How much temperature does one small division 
indicate? 
 — So, the smallest value that the thermometer can 
read is 
Fig. 7.3b shows a closeup of a part of the  thermometer 
shown in Fig. 7.3a. Can you now find the smallest value that 
this thermometer can read?
For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the 
temperature
 difference indicated between 0 °C 
and 
10 °C or between 10  °C and 20 °C is 
10 °C. And the 
number of divisions between these marks are 10 
divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C.  
That is, the smallest value that this thermometer 
can read is
 1 °C.
Your school laboratory may have thermometers 
for which 
the range and the value of the smallest 
division may be different. It is, therefore, always 
necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you 
are about to
 use.
You have learnt

   When the thermometer 
is immersed in water, its 
bulb should not touch 
the bottom or the sides 
of the beaker.
   The thermometer 
should be held 
vertically (Fig. 7.4). It 
should not be tilted.

  Take some warm water in a beaker. 
  Dip the thermometer in water so that the bulb is 
immersed in water (Fig. 7.4).
  Observe the rise of liquid column in the thermometer. 
Wait till the column stops rising and note the 
temperature (do not wait too long; otherwise, 
the water itself will start to cool).
What is the temperature of water 
measured by you? Compare it with the 
readings of your friends.
Do you notice that, as soon as you take the 
thermometer out of the water, the level of liquid 
column begins to fall?
This means that the temperature must be read 
while the thermometer is immersed in water.
